# Ain-i-Akbari by Abu'l Fazal
>Abul Fazal’s Ain-e-Akbari is a vivid account of the socio-economic and religious life in medieval India. #introduction 
## Socio-economic life
- Caste system was prevalent and 16 different sub castes arose from inter-marriages.
- Choice of occupation was still limited by caste credentials.
- Land was the major source of revenue. Raja Todarmal’s land measurement and assessment improved tax collection.
- Literature, music, art and architecture commanded royal patronage.
## Religion
- Religious discrimination was ended by Akbar. Jaziya and Pilgrim tax were abolished.
- There was greater religious freedom. Akbar’s **Din-e-Ilahi** tried bringing people of different faith together.
- Abul Fazal’s attempt at finding common ground between Hindu practices and Islamic beliefs betrays the existing differences.
- Hindus were tried under Hindu laws.
- Appointed **Mutawallis** to manage Waqf properties.
## Inconsistencies
- Abul Fazl enjoyed royal patronage of Akbar so one can imagine he was under obligation to praise the emperor. 
- In such an attempt, he said Akbar could control rain at will. 
- On the other hand Fazal emphasises on the need of rationality. This was a major inconsistency. 
>Despite its shortcomings, Abul Fazl’s profound scholarship gives a great insight into the history of medieval India.
