	- First amendment to the Indian [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/CONSTITUTION BOC\|Constitution]] put restrictions on 'freedom of speech and expression', while first amendment to the US Constitution made the freedom of speech and expression an absolute right.

		- Right to property was enshrined as fundamental right under article 19 and 31. The provinces passed the Zamindari Abolition Acts but all these acts were challenged in the court on account of their constitutional validity. The supreme court upheld the rights of Zamindars. To secure the constitutional validity of these state acts, the parliament passed [[1st Amendment\|first amendment]] (1951) within 15 months of enactment of the constitution and second amendment in 1959.

- Adding special provisions in favour of "socially and educationally backward classes"  - Article 15(4).
	- It allowed the government to make reservations for these groups in educational institutions to promote their advancement and upliftment.

>The First Amendment was a significant change to the Fundamental Rights provisions of the Indian constitution. It gave the government more power to restrict freedom of expression and it made it more difficult to challenge laws that violate the Fundamental Rights. These amendments have also played a vital role in shaping India's legal and social landscape. #conclusion
