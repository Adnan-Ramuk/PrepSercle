## Bhimbetka paintings
>Considered as evidence of long cultural continuity. Continuous occupation from 10,000 BCE to 1,000 CE. 
- Located in [[Satpura Ranges\|Satpura Ranges]]
- About 400 painted rock shelters in 5 clusters
- In Bhimbetka, we can see nearly 20 layers of paintings, one on top of another.
	- Earliest paintings are mostly linear representations of humans and animals filled with geometric patterns
	- Mesolithic paintings are larger in number with multiple themes, but smaller in size. Community dances provide a common theme.
	- Pottery and metal tools can be seen in paintings of Chalcolithic period.
- Evidences of music in ancient India can be found here.
- Evidences of dance in ancient India can be found here.

Mesolithic rock cut architecture of India not only reflects the cultural life of the times but also a fine aesthetic sense comparable to modern painting. Critically evaluate this comment. ( #PYMQ/anc/paintings/prehistoric 2015/200/12.5 )
