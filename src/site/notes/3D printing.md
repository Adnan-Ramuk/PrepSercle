# 3D printing
> 3D printing, or ==additive manufacturing==, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD (computer aided design) model or a digital 3D model.

## Advantages of 3D printing
1. Lowers cost
2. Saves time - highly efficient
3. durable and high quality
4. functional models - gives real picture
5. flexibility

## Applications of 3D printing
1. Architecture and construction - actual construction and models - 3D buildings
2. Medicine - prosthetic, hearing aids, artificial organs.
3. Manufacturing of automobiles and parts. eg. cars and aeroplane.
4. Maritime industry - spare parts for ship building.
5. Others - clothing and engineering.

## 3D printing in India
- The government has launched several initiatives such as ‘[[Make in India\|Make in India]]’, ‘[[Digital India\|Digital India]]’ and ‘Skill India’ to improve investment opportunities and to enhance manufacturing capabilities in the country.
- Given the government’s interest in boosting manufacturing, major manufacturers have established 3-D printing assembly lines and distribution centres in partnership with foreign technological firms.
-  A PwC report titled ‘The Global [[Industry 4.0\|Industry 4.0]]’ in 2016 shows that in India, 27% of industries have either already invested or will be investing in AM technology within the next five years.
-  The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) will soon come up with a policy aimed at promoting 3D printing on an industrial scale in view of its emerging market.
## Challenges
- Lack of Standards: Since 3D printing is a very niche and new domain, there are no global qualifications and certification norms.
- Hesitation in Adoption: Another challenge is to convince the industry and ministries to push for its adoption in their respective sectors as any new technology, which is not understood easily, faces a tough time.
- Risk of Job Losses: In the initial meetings on the subject, there was a lot of resistance on whether this technology would eat into the jobs of highly-skilled workers in the medical equipment or aerospace technology sectors.
- High Cost: Although actual printing is cheap, parts to build a 3D printer are very expensive as the equipment and manufacturing costs are very high. In addition, there is a concern about warranty hence, resource companies are hesitant to put 3D-printed parts into their machines if they are not covered for damage in case the parts fail.
- Sector Specific Challenges: Globally and even in India, the largest consumer of 3D printing is the automotive industry and right now it is going through changes like the introduction of BS-VI and electric vehicles. New vehicle design development has slowed and so has the demand for 3D printing.
