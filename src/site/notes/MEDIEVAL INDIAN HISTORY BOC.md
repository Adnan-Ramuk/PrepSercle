# MEDIEVAL INDIAN HISTORY TOC

This period can be categorized into two periods: the 'early medieval period,' which lasted from the 6th to the 12th century, and the 'late medieval period,' which lasted from the 13th to the 18th century. Although the Mughal era is often referred to as the early modern period, it is included in the 'late medieval' period in this context.
