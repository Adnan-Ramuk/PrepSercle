# Decline of the Mughals and Rise of regional kingdoms

## Decline of the Mughals
The Mughal empire entered a phase of rapid decline by the end of the reign of [[Mughal Empire#Aurangzeb 1658-1707\|Aurangzeb]].

### Reasons for the decline of Mughal Empire
- **Aurangzeb's religious orthodoxy** and his policy towards Hindu rulers damaged stability of the empire.

- Aurangzeb's conflicts with the Rajputs, which commenced in the early 1680s, henceforth became a contributing factor towards the downfall of the Mughal empire. 

</div></div>

- **Jagirdari crisis** - emerged during the last era. The Deccan wars waged by Aurangzeb was definitely a reason.
	- His **expansionary military campaigns** especially related to Deccan also contributed to the decline.
- **Recurring peasant revolts** - this was a common phenomenon by the late 18th century. The ==Jagirdari system weakened which led to emergence of powerful landlords in the countryside.==
- **Crisis of personalities** – [[Mughal Empire#Mughal rulers\|weak rulers after Aurangzeb]].
- **Political rivalries and internal dissensions** – strong factionalism emerged within the nobility along with court intrigues.
- **Rise of Provincial kingdoms** - As the Mughal rule weakened many regional kingdoms asserted themselves like the Marathas, Jats, Awadh, Mysore, Hyderabad, Bengal etc.

## Rise of regional Kingdoms
There were two types of newly formed states:
1. Autonomous states which had submitted to Mughal suzerainty e.g.  Rajputs, Marathas, Mysore etc.
2. Independent states found by Mughal provincial governors. e.g. Awadh, Hyderabad, Bengal, Arcot etc.

### Nature of polity
During 18th century, India was a land of contrasts - extreme poverty and extreme luxury existed side by side. But their life in 18th century was by and large better than it was after 100 years of British rule.
- **Fragmented polity** - various sovereign independent provinces emerged in the 18th century. **Emergence of ‘centrifugal forces'**.
- **Decentralization of power**- the weakening of the empire led to the emergence of new regional powers. The centralized structure under the Mughals were destroyed.
- **Symbolic authority of the Mughals**- Mughal’s remained the source for political legitimacy.
- **Despotism** - in Mughal and Maratha states.

	- It was founded by Shivaji for the sound system of administration which was greatly inspired from the **Deccan style of administration**. Most of the administrative reforms were inspired from **Malik Amber** reforms in Ahmednagar.
	- Shivaji divided entire territory into three provinces, each under a viceroy. He further **divided the provinces into Prants then Pargana and Tarafs**. The lowest unit was the village which was headed by its headman or Patel.
	- The King was the supreme head of state who was assisted by a group of eight ministers known as the **Ashtapradhan**.

			- Nyayadhish - Administration of Justice
			- Punditrao - Looking after charitable and religious affairs of the state. He worked for the moral upliftment of the people.
			- > Apart from the departmental duties, three of the ministers - Peshwas, Sachiv and the Mantri were also given in charge of extensive provinces.

	- Shivaji strictly supervised the **Mirasdars** who had hereditary rights in land.
	- The revenue system was patterned on the **Kathi system of Malik Amber**. According to this system, every piece of land was measured by Rod or Kathi.
	- Local level - **Watan jagirs**: non-transferable, **Saranjams** – temporary land ownership. Powerful landed aristocracy were a feature.
	- **Chauth and Sardeshmukhi** were other sources of income: 
		- Chauth was amounted to 1/4th of the standard which was paid to Marathas as a safeguard against Shivaji’s forces plundering or raiding Non-Maratha territories. 
		- Sardeshmukhi was an additional levy of 10 percent demanded from areas outside from the kingdom.
- **Military Administration**
	- Shivaji organised a disciplined and efficient army. The ordinary soldiers were paid in cash, but big chief and military commander were paid through jagir grants (Saranjam or Mokasa).
	- The army consists of Infantry i.e. Mavali foot soldiers; Cavalry i.e. Horse riders and equipment holders; Navy.

		- The army was effective instrument of policies of Marathas State where rapidity of movement was the most important factors. Only in the rainy season, the army get rested otherwise rest of the year was engaged in expeditions.
		- **Pindaries** were allowed to accompany the army who were allowed to collect “**Pal-Patti**”which was 25% of war booty.
	- Important battles: Battle of Palkhed, Battle of Bhopal, Third Battle of Panipat, [[Anglo-Maratha wars\|Anglo-Maratha wars]] etc.

>Maratha’s system of administration was largely borrowed from the administrative practices of the Deccan states. Hence, the Marathas had important positions among administrative and military system in the contemporary kingdoms especially Ahmednagar and Bijapur.
