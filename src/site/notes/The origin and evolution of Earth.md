# The origin and evolution
## The Big Bang
- As per the standard model of cosmos, the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
- The best-supported theory of our universe's origin centers on an event known as the **big bang**. 
- This theory was born of the observation that **other galaxies are moving away from our own at great speed in all directions, as if they had all been propelled by an ancient explosive force.**
- A Belgian priest named **Georges Lemaître** first suggested the big bang theory in the 1920s, when he theorized that the universe began from a single **primordial atom**. 
- The idea received major boosts from **Edwin Hubble**'s observations that galaxies are speeding away from us in all directions, as well as from the 1960s discovery of **cosmic microwave background radiation**-interpreted as echoes of the big bang-by **Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson**.
- A lot of what we know about the early universe comes from experiments done in giant **particle colliders**.
- Further work has helped clarify the big bang's tempo. 
- **Here’s the theory:** In the first 10^-43 seconds of its existence, the universe was very compact, less than a million billion billionth the size of a single atom. 
- It's thought that at such an incomprehensibly dense, energetic state, the four fundamental forces-gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces-were forged into a single force, but our current theories haven't yet figured out how a single, unified force would work. 
	- To pull this off, we'd need to know how gravity works on the subatomic scale, but we currently don't.
- It's also thought that the extremely close quarters allowed the universe's very first particles to mix, mingle, and settle into roughly the same temperature. 
- Then, in an unimaginably small fraction of a second, all that matter and energy expanded outward more or less evenly, with tiny variations provided by **fluctuations on the quantum scale**. 
- That model of breakneck expansion, called **inflation**, may explain why the universe has such an even temperature and distribution of matter.
- After inflation, the universe continued to expand but at a much slower rate. ==It's still unclear what exactly powered inflation.==
- ==Time and space also started with the Big Bang.==
- It expanded and cooled, going through multiple stages where different kinds of matter could form. 
- *In the very first second all four forces were separated and very basic subatomic particles could hold themselves together.*
- As the universe kept expanding, this piping-hot primordial soup-called the **quark-gluon plasma**-continued to cool. 
	- Some particle colliders, such as **CERN's Large Hadron Collider**, are powerful enough to re-create the quark-gluon plasma.
- *3 minutes later, the universe got cooled enough so that these sub-atomic particles could stick together. (formation of hydrogen and helium nuclei)*
	- By mass, hydrogen was 75 percent of the early universe's matter, and helium was 25 percent. The abundance of helium is a key prediction of big bang theory, and it's been confirmed by scientific observations.
- Normal matter formed atoms between 3 and 20 minutes after the bang, and the lumps left over from inflation formed the galaxies and larger structures we see today.
- *After 380,000 years stable neutral atoms formed - this event is called **Recombination**.*
- The cooler universe made it transparent for the first time, which let the photons rattling around within it finally zip through unimpeded.
	- We still see this primordial afterglow today as **cosmic microwave background radiation**, which is found throughout the universe. 
	- The radiation is similar to that used to transmit TV signals via antennae. But it is the oldest radiation known and may hold many secrets about the universe's earliest moments.
- *There wasn't a single star in the universe until about 180 million years after the big bang.* ==It took that long for gravity to gather clouds of hydrogen and forge them into stars.== Many physicists think that vast clouds of **dark matter**, a still-unknown material that outweighs visible matter by more than five to one, provided a gravitational scaffold for the first galaxies and stars.
- *By 400 million years after the big bang, the first galaxies were born. In the billions of years since, stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies have formed and re-formed - eventually yielding our home galaxy, the **Milky Way**, and our cosmic home, the solar system.*
- Even now the universe is expanding, and to astronomers' surprise, ==the pace of expansion is accelerating.== 
- It's thought that this acceleration is driven by a force that repels gravity called **dark energy**. We still don't know what dark energy is, but it’s thought that it makes up ==**68 percent of the universe's total matter and energy**==. 
- ==Dark matter makes up another 27 percent.== 
- In essence, all the matter you've ever seen-from your first love to the stars overhead-makes up less than five percent of the universe.

## Formation of solar system
- ![Pasted image 20220711211313.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220711211313.png)
- ==Solar system was formed about 4.8 billion years ago from a nebula.==
- Our solar system consists of the sun (the star), 8 planets, many moons, millions of smaller bodies like asteroids and comets and huge quantity of dust-grains and gases.
- Out of the eight planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are called as the **inner planets** as they lie between the sun and the belt of asteroids the other four planets are called the **outer planets**.
- Alternatively, the first four are called **Terrestrial,** meaning earth-like as they are made up of rock and metals, and have relatively high densities.
- The rest four are called **Jovian or Gas Giant planets**. Jovian means Jupiter-like. Most of them are much larger than the terrestrial planets and have thick atmosphere, mostly of helium and hydrogen.
- The difference between terrestrial and Jovian planets can be attributed to the following conditions:
	- The terrestrial planets were formed in the close vicinity of the parent star where it was too warm for gases to condense to solid particles. Jovian planets were formed at quite a distant location.
	- The solar wind was most intense nearer the sun; so, it blew off lots of gas and dust from the terrestrial planets. The solar winds were not all that intense to cause similar removal of gases from the Jovian planets.
	- The terrestrial planets are smaller and their lower gravity could not hold the escaping gases.
- Till August 2006, **Pluto** was also considered a planet. However, in a meeting of the **International Astronomical Union**, a decision was taken that Pluto like other celestial objects (2003 UB313) discovered in recent past may be called ‘**dwarf planet**’
### Planets of our solar system
- **Mercury**: Mercury is closest to the sun. It has a temperature range of 427ºC on its side facing the Sun and – 270ºC, on its dark side. ==It has no atmosphere.==
- **Venus**: Venus is the closest neighbour of the earth. It is about 40 million km away. It is an extremely hot planet with a temperature of 480ºC. Its atmosphere has 96% [[Carbon dioxide\|carbon dioxide]] and poisonous gases like Sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide.
- ==**Earth**: Earth is the only planet known to sustain life. It lies in the **Goldilocks zone**. ==
	- Circumstellar habitable zone: In astronomy and astrobiology, the circumstellar habitable zone, or simply the habitable zone, is the range of orbits around a star within which a planetary surface can support liquid water given sufficient atmospheric pressure.
- **Mars**: Mars is also close to earth. It is called the red planet. It has 95% carbon monoxide and reddish dust. It is relatively a very cold planet and as of now presence of life on it has not been conclusively established.
- **Jupiter**: Jupiter is the largest planet of the solar system. It is mainly a rapidly spinning ball of gas specially clouds of ammonia, and has no solid surface.
- **Saturn**: Saturn consists mainly of hydrogen and helium. Its atmosphere has 90% nitrogen and a temperature of (-184ºC). It is also made up of hydrogen cyanide which is a highly poisonous gas. It is characterized by a ring that surrounds it.
- **Uranus**: Uranus is also a very cold planet. Uranus is a distant planet of solar system and 7th in order from the sun. Uranus and Neptune are the outermost planets of the solar system. ==Uranus has a highly tilted rotational axis.==
- **Neptune**: Neptune is cold and dark with its surface coated with frozen methane.

## Classification of Celestial Bodies
![Pasted image 20220711204411.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220711204411.png)
### Stars
- Stars are giant balls of hot gases that can produce their own light. 
- Stars give out energy by converting Hydrogen gas into Helium in their cores. 
- Stars are gigantic in size and have an immense gravitational attraction. 
- The sun is a medium-sized star that gives us energy and makes life possible on earth.
- The color of a star is defined by its temperature. The coolest stars appear red, while the hottest stars appear blue.
### Planets
- Planets are large (almost) spherical objects that revolve around stars. 
- Planets move in fixed orbits around the star. 
- Planets may be made of rocks, metals and gases like hydrogen, nitrogen and methane.  
- Planets that revolve around other stars are called **exoplanets**.
### Satellites
- Satellites are objects that revolve around planets. They form the essential part of the celestial bodies. 
- These may be of natural origin or sent by humans. 
- The moon is a natural satellite of the earth and revolves around it because it is bound by the Earth’s gravitational pull. 
- We have also placed artificial or human-made satellites around the earth and other planets to study them and for communication purposes.
### Comets
- These are small chunks of ice and rock that come from the outer edge of the solar system. 
- When its orbit brings it closer to the sun, the ice on them vaporizes, creating a beautiful tail behind them.
### Asteroids
- These are small irregularly shaped rocks made up of metal or minerals that orbit the sun. 
- Most of them are found between Mars and Jupiter in an area known as the **asteroid belt**.
### Meteors and meteorites
- These are objects from space that enter our atmosphere as they are pulled by the earth’s gravity. 
- Meteors usually are small and burn up in the atmosphere as they enter the earth. 
- This creates streaks in the sky as though a star has fallen. They are commonly called **shooting stars**. 
- If a meteor is large enough it can reach the ground and create a crater. Such objects are called **meteorites**.
### Galaxies
- Galaxies are large groups of stars held together by gravity. 
- The sun and the solar system is part of a galaxy known as the **Milky Way**. 
- Other galaxies are usually so far away that they look like stars in the night sky. 
- The **Andromeda galaxy** and the **Large Magellanic Cloud** are galaxies that can be seen with the naked eye on a clear night.

## The Life and Death of Stars
### How are stars born? 
- Early in the history of the universe, before stars and planets existed, giant clouds of hydrogen and helium began to form. 
- Slowly, these clouds collected enough mass for their own gravity to form. This created extremely dense balls of gas. In other words, they formed stars.  
- When a new star is formed, its core is exposed to very strong gravitational forces. This force is so great that the star is in danger of collapsing in on itself. Luckily, ==nuclear fusion provides the energy the star needs to push back against the collapsing core.== 
	- Nuclear fusion is a process where the nuclei of two or more elements combine to produce nuclei of heavier elements. Nuclear fusion also releases energy.
- ==In the core of a newly formed star, hydrogen nuclei begin to fuse into helium. The inward pull of gravity and the outward push of nuclear fusion eventually balance out. For a time, hydrogen fusion prevents the collapse of the star.==
- ![Pasted image 20220711205126.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220711205126.png)
- When the young star runs out of hydrogen, its core will once again begin to collapse. The extreme forces on the core causes it to heat up. 
- Soon, the core is hot enough that it can begin to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen. Once again, nuclear fusion pushes back against gravity to prevent the star from collapsing. 
- One by one, the star fuses each new element. This successively produces elements with low atomic masses like carbon, oxygen, and neon. 
- Not only does nuclear fusion keep stars from collapsing, it enabled the first stars in the universe to create new elements that had never existed before! ==Depending on their size, stars can create elements through fusion, up to iron, which has an atomic number of 26.==
### How do stars die?
![Pasted image 20220711205238.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220711205238.png)
- Even though stars are not living things, they have “life cycles” and at some point they are said to “die.” How a star lives and dies depends on how large it is. 
- The smallest stars, **brown dwarf** stars, are too large to be considered planets, but too small to be considered stars. They are unable to sustain the fusion of hydrogen because of their low mass, and are often called "**failed stars**." 
- The small, slow-burning **red dwarf** stars have very long lives. Their lives last between one and ten trillion years! Scientists believe that when red dwarf stars eventually collapse, they will become **white dwarf stars**. These are very dense stars that no longer burn fuel. Scientists also believe that eventually, the white dwarf stars in the universe will cool off and become **black dwarf stars**. 
- When mid-sized stars, like the Sun, run out of hydrogen, their cores will contract and heat up. The outer layers of gas will expand and the stars will become red giant stars. Eventually when the core of a **red giant star** cools, the remaining gas will float into space, forming a **planetary nebula**. ==Each planetary nebula has a white dwarf star at its core.== 
	- When the Sun becomes a red giant, it will grow so huge that it will swallow Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth before becoming a planetary nebula.
- The very largest stars first become **blue supergiant stars** before dying in a dramatic fashion. In fact, they create the biggest explosions in the universe when they collapse. We call these explosions **supernovas**.
	- ==A supernova is so bright that it can outshine an entire galaxy of a hundred billion stars!==
	- The initial explosion of a supernova has so much energy that it can split atoms apart at the core, sending protons and neutrons flying into the universe. 
	- In the moments following the explosion, these particles crash into each other with enough energy to fuse back together. 
	- Light elements continue colliding with protons and neutrons in this way, constantly growing larger and larger. 
	- This process, which is similar to nuclear fusion, is called **nucleosynthesis**. 
	- The nucleosynthesis that occurs during the explosion of a supernova produces elements with a higher atomic number than iron, which cannot be created by nuclear fusion.
	-  When the first stars died out this way, brand new elements, including gold, were formed. Eventually, those elements ended up here on Earth.
- After a supernova explodes, the core that remains becomes a **neutron star**. This is an extremely small and dense type of star. For the largest stars of all, the remaining core is so massive and has such a strong gravitational pull that not even light can escape. This is called a **stellar black hole**.
	- ==**A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.**==

# Some important astronomical objects and phenomena
- **Nebulas:** Nebulas are vast clouds of dust and gas in space, primarily made up of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of other elements. They are often regions where new stars are born, as gravity causes the gas and dust to clump together and eventually form stars.
- **Galaxies:** Galaxies are vast systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. They come in various shapes and sizes, including spiral, elliptical, and irregular, and can contain billions to trillions of stars.
- **Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN):** AGN are extremely bright and energetic centers of some galaxies, where supermassive black holes are accreting large amounts of matter. This accretion process releases enormous amounts of energy, making AGN some of the most luminous objects in the universe. Quasars are a particularly luminous type of AGN.
- **Neutron Stars:** Neutron stars are the collapsed cores of massive stars that have undergone a supernova explosion. They are incredibly dense, with masses typically about 1.4 times that of the Sun packed into a sphere with a radius of about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) or less. They often rotate rapidly and have strong magnetic fields.
- **Supernovae:** Supernovae are powerful and luminous explosions that occur at the end of a star's life cycle. They result in the creation of neutron stars or black holes and are significant sources of heavy elements in the universe. Supernovae can briefly outshine entire galaxies and release vast amounts of energy.
- **Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs):** GRBs are short-lived bursts of gamma-ray radiation, which are the most energetic form of light. They are thought to be produced by various astrophysical processes, including supernova explosions and the merger of neutron stars. GRBs can outshine entire galaxies for brief periods.
- **Pulsars:** Pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation out of their magnetic poles. As the star rotates, these beams can be observed as pulses of radiation, hence the name "pulsar."
- **Magnetars:** Magnetars are a type of neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field. These magnetic fields can be a thousand times stronger than those of typical neutron stars and are capable of producing powerful bursts of X-rays and gamma rays.
- **Quasars:** Quasars are extremely luminous and energetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) found at the centers of some galaxies. They are powered by supermassive black holes that are actively accreting matter, which emits intense radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum.
- **White Dwarfs:** White dwarfs are the remnants of low to medium mass stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and shed their outer layers. They are incredibly dense, with a mass comparable to that of the Sun but with a volume similar to that of Earth. They gradually cool and fade over time.
- **Black Holes:** Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle.
- **Cepheid Variables:** Cepheid variables are a type of star that pulsates radially, varying in brightness with a well-defined stable period and amplitude. These stars are important in determining distances in astronomy, as their pulsation period is directly related to their luminosity.
