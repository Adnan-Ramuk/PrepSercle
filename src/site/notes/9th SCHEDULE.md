# 9th Schedule of the Constitution
>The 9th Schedule of the Constitution contains a list of central and state laws that enjoy immunity from judicial review and cannot be challenged in courts. It was introduced with the first amendment in 1951 to safeguard laws related to land reforms and social welfare. #introduction 
## Laws in the 9th Schedule
- The 9th Schedule was originally added to protect land reforms and other welfare laws from legal challenges that sought to protect the interests of marginalized sections of society.
- Most of the laws protected under the 9th Schedule are related to agriculture and land issues. Additionally, some laws, like the one in Tamil Nadu providing 69% reservation, are also included in this schedule.
- Over the years, the 9th Schedule has been amended multiple times to include various laws, leading to debates on whether it undermines the principle of judicial review.
## Judicial Review and the 9th Schedule
- In the landmark #case of IR Coelho vs State of Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court held that laws placed in the 9th Schedule were open to judicial scrutiny, implying that such laws could not be given blanket protection.
- The Supreme Court laid down a dual test to examine the validity of a law placed in the Ninth Schedule:
	1. Whether the law violates any fundamental right.
	2. If yes, whether the violation also damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution.
- Only if the answer to both questions is affirmative can a law placed in the Ninth Schedule be declared unconstitutional.

The 9th Schedule serves as a mechanism to protect certain laws from judicial challenges, especially those aimed at promoting social welfare and land reforms. While it provides immunity, the Supreme Court's ruling ensures that laws in this schedule are still subject to scrutiny if they infringe upon fundamental rights or undermine the basic structure of the Constitution. As the legal landscape evolves, any potential changes to the 9th Schedule and its implications on judicial review will continue to be a matter of interest and debate. #conclusion #summary
