# Air Masses
>It is defined as a large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture. When the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, it acquires the characteristics of the area. #definition #introduction 

- Homogenous regions, such as vast ocean surfaces or plains, are called source regions. The development of an air mass requires large-scale subsidence of air over the source region, causing it to acquire the properties of that area.
- Air masses are classified based on the source region and air mass modification, resulting in categories like tropical maritime, tropical continental, polar maritime, and polar continental air masses.
- When an air mass undergoes heating or cooling from the surface below, it is referred to as a thermodynamic change.
- The homogenous regions can be the vast ocean surface or vast plains. 
- The homogenous surfaces are called the source regions. 
- The necessary conditions for development of an airmass are large scale subsidence of air over the source region. The subsiding air acquires the properties of the source region.
- They are classified based on the source region and air mass modification. 
	- Thus there can be tropical maritime air mass, tropical continental air mass, polar maritime air mass, polar continental air mass. 
	- When the air mass is heated or cooled from the surface below, it is called a thermodynamic change.

## How it affects climate
- Change in local weather: An air mass on the move begins to transform as it passes over new landscapes, while at the same time retaining enough of its original conditions to alter local weather. For example, a cP air mass move south in winters and brings frigid temperatures to the central ï»¿United States. While dry in its source region, such an air mass often picks up substantial moisture during an early-winter transit of the Great Lakes, allowing it to dump 'lake effect snow' on leeward coasts.
- Cyclones and Anti-cyclones: collision of two air masses leads to formation of fronts. For instance, when polar and tropical air masses merge in the mid-latitudes, prevailing westerly winds funnel along alternating low- and high-pressure centers causing cyclones and anticyclones, respectively.
- Rainfall: It also causes precipitation and temperature change in many regions. Maritime-tropical air sourced over warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico is the main contributor of precipitation for much of North America east of the Rocky Mountains. 
- Cooling effect: Maritime air masses also contribute to a moderating climatic influence on coastal temperatures, as oceans heat up and cool down more slowly and less dramatically than landmasses.
- When a warm air moves over a cold surface, [[Temperature inversion\|temperature inversion]] results which inhibits further vertical cooling.
- If a cold air mass moves over a warm surface, convectional currents are formed. This leads to formation of vertical clouds (cumulus) and air turbulence.
- **Temperature Inversion:** When warm air moves over a cold surface, a temperature inversion occurs, inhibiting further vertical cooling. This phenomenon can lead to stable atmospheric conditions.
- **Convectional Currents and Cloud Formation:** If a cold air mass moves over a warm surface, convectional currents are formed, resulting in the formation of vertical clouds, such as cumulus clouds, and air turbulence.

>The concept of air masses is crucial in understanding macro-climatic changes. The movement and interaction of different air masses play a pivotal role in shaping weather patterns and climatic conditions in various regions. By comprehending the characteristics and behaviour of air masses, meteorologists and climatologists can better predict weather phenomena and study long-term climate trends. #conclusion

# Air Masses and Their Role in Macro-Climatic Changes
An air mass is defined as a large body of air with relatively consistent temperature and moisture characteristics. These air masses form over homogenous regions, such as vast ocean surfaces or plains, acquiring the properties of the area they reside over. The interaction and movement of different air masses play a pivotal role in shaping weather patterns and climatic conditions. 
## Characteristics and Formation of Air Masses
Air masses develop in source regions, where large-scale subsidence of air causes it to acquire the properties of the region. They are classified based on their source region and modifications they undergo during their movement. These classifications include tropical maritime, tropical continental, polar maritime, and polar continental air masses. When an air mass experiences thermodynamic changes due to heating or cooling from the surface below, it leads to alterations in its characteristics.
## Impact on Climate and Weather
Air masses have significant effects on climate and weather:
- **Local Weather Transformation**: When an air mass moves over new landscapes, it transforms while retaining some original conditions, altering local weather. For instance, a cP air mass moving south in winter brings frigid temperatures to central United States and picks up moisture over the Great Lakes, causing 'lake effect snow'.
- **Formation of Cyclones and Anti-cyclones**: The collision of two air masses leads to the creation of fronts, causing cyclones and anticyclones. For example, merging polar and tropical air masses in mid-latitudes generates cyclones and anticyclones due to westerly winds.
- **Rainfall and Temperature Changes**: Air masses contribute to precipitation and temperature changes. Maritime-tropical air masses from warm waters contribute to precipitation in North America. They also moderate coastal temperatures due to oceans' slower heating and cooling.
- **Temperature Inversion and Convectional Currents**: Warm air over cold surfaces results in temperature inversion, inhibiting further vertical cooling. Cold air over warm surfaces creates convectional currents, forming vertical clouds and air turbulence.
## Role in Macro-Climatic Changes
Understanding air masses is crucial for comprehending macro-climatic changes. Their movement and interaction shape weather patterns and long-term climate trends. Meteorologists and climatologists rely on air mass characteristics to predict weather phenomena and study climate shifts.

Air masses, as defined bodies of air with consistent properties, play a pivotal role in shaping weather and climate. Their classification, formation, and interactions lead to various climatic effects, from local weather transformations to the formation of cyclones. By studying air masses, experts gain insights into macro-climatic changes, aiding in weather prediction and climate trend analysis.
