This change meant that the government could acquire private property for public purposes without paying compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Extension of Emergency Provisions**     | This Act extended the operation of the internal Emergency imposed by the 42nd Amendment. The amendment changed the term "Internal Disturbance" to "Armed Rebellion" for the declaration of Emergency under Article 352. It also made it mandatory for the President to act on the written advice of the Council of Ministers. The President's discretion to revoke the Emergency was also curtailed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Scope of Judicial Review**              | This Act amended Article 368 to exclude any amendment made under Article 368 from the scope of judicial review. It sought to restrict the Supreme Court's power to review constitutional amendments made by Parliament. However, the Supreme Court later held that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is not unlimited and that it cannot destroy or abrogate the "basic structure" of the Constitution. The "basic structure" doctrine was established in the Kesavananda Bharati case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

- The 44th Constitutional Amendment Act provides that, “As a further check against the misuse of the Emergency provisions and to put the right to life and liberty on a secure footing, it would be provided that  the power to suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of a fundamental right cannot be  exercised in respect of the fundamental right to life and liberty. The right to liberty is further strengthened by the provision that a law for preventive detention cannot authorise, in any case, detention for a longer period than two months, unless an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention. An additional safeguard would be provided by the requirement that the Chairman of an Advisory Board shall be a serving Judge of the appropriate High Court and that the Board shall be constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief Justice of that High Court.” Here the appropriate High Court refers to,
	- For a person detained by the order of Government of India it is the High Court of the Union territory of Delhi. For a person detained by the order of Government of any State (other than a Union territory), it is the High Court for that State. For a person detained by the order of the administrator of a Union territory, it is the High Court as may be specified by or under any law made by Parliament. The date for the substitution of this provision under article 22 is yet to be notified by the Government.

>The 44th CAA remains a critical moment in Indian constitutional history, with its implications continuing to be debated and analyzed by legal scholars and policymakers. #conclusion
