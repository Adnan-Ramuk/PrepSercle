# Introduction to Disaster Management
>Disaster is a serious disruption in the functioning of a community or a society causing widespread material, economic, social or environmental losses which exceed the ability of affected society to cope using its own resources. #definition 

>Hazard is a dangerous condition or event, that have the potential for causing injury to life or damage to property or the environment.” #definition 

- ![Pasted image 20220926191939.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220926191939.png)

>Vulnerability is the “conditions determined by physical, social, economic, and environmental factors or processes, which increase the susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards.” #definition 

- Vulnerability may be of different forms, such as:
	- Economic Vulnerability: Poorer families cannot afford to live in safer areas.
	- Physical Vulnerability: Wooden homes are less vulnerable to earthquake, but more to fire.
	- Social Vulnerability: Children, elderly and differently abled, may be unable to protect themselves during a disaster.
	- >How important are vulnerability and risk assessment for pre-disaster management? As an administrator, what are key areas that you would focus on in a Disaster Management System? #PYMQ, 2013

>Risk is a “measure of the expected losses due to a hazard event occurring in a given area over a specific time period.
- Risk = Hazard x Vulnerability

>Capacity is the combination of all the strengths, attributes and resources available within an organization, community or society to manage and reduce disaster risks and strengthen resilience. 
- Capacity may include infrastructure, institutions, human knowledge and skills, and collective attributes such as social relationships, leadership and management.
- Coping capacities contribute to the reduction of disaster risks.
- Classification of disasters
	- Natural disasters are caused because of natural phenomena (meteorological, geological or even biological origin). Examples: cyclones, tsunamis, earthquake and volcanic eruption.
	- Manmade disasters occur due to human negligence. These are associated with industries or energy generation facilities and include explosions, leakage of toxic waste, pollution, dam failure, wars etc. 

- Disaster Management includes sum total of all activities, programmes and measures which can be taken up before, during and after a disaster.
	- Pre-disaster risk management phase: prevention, mitigation and preparedness.
	- Post-disaster crisis management phase: relief, response, rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery.

## National Disaster Management Act, (NDMA) 2005
- A paradigm shift from, **relief-centric activity based reactive approach** to a **proactive multidimensional, institutional structure based on holistic approach** for disaster risk reduction.
- The Act lays down institutional, legal, financial and coordination mechanisms at the National, State, District and Local levels. 
	- NDMA - national level, SDMAs - state level and DDMAs - district level.
	- Primary responsibility for management of disaster rests with the State Government concerned. 
	- This hierarchical yet integrated institutional mechanism helps states to manage disasters in an effective manner.
### Institutional Framework at National Level

#### National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
- Specialised response force established under section 44 of DMA, 2005
- Command and supervision vests in DG of NDRF.
- Its proactive availability and pre-positioning in threatening disaster situation has helped to minimise damage.
	- e.g. Kosi floods of 2008, Nepal earthquake in 2015 are success stories of NDRF.
- NDRF have been stationed at more than 10 centres in India.
### Institutional Framework at State Level
![Pasted image 20220926230347.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220926230347.png)

#### State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA)

### Institutional Framework at District Level
#### District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA)
- Headed by DM and Chairman of District panchayat is co-chairman
- Prepares disaster management plan for district and monitor its implementation.
### Local Authorities
- [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/STATE/LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOC\|PRIs]], Municipalities, Cantonment Boards, Town Planning Authorities ensure capacity building of employees for disaster management.
- Prepare disaster management plans at local level.

### Financial Arrangements under NDM Act, 2005
- National Disaster Response Fund: 
	- Managed by Centre for meeting the expenses for emergency response, relief and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation.
	- If the requirement of funds for relief operations is beyond the funds available in the State Disaster Response Fund account, additional Central assistance is provided from National Disaster Response Fund. 
- State Disaster Response Fund:
	- The SDRF is used only for meeting the expenditure for providing immediate relief to the victims of disasters. 
	- The state-specific disasters within the local context in the State, which are not included in the notified list of disasters, are also eligible for assistance from State Disaster Response Fund. 
- The National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF):
	- Not been set up. 
	- Objective of creation of NDMF is for the projects exclusively for the purpose of mitigation, currently served by the existing CSS/CS as PMKSY, NMSA, Namami Gange etc.
- National Disaster Response Reserve:
	- Recommended by 13th [[Finance Commission\|Finance Commission]] to mitigate sufferings of victims beyond coping capacity of states.
- Recommendations of 14th Finance Commission on Fund Mobilisation for DM:
	- Up to 10% funds available under SDRF can be used by states for disasters which, state consider as a disaster within the local context and are not in the notified list of disasters of MoHA
	- Union should ensure assured source for NDR Fund once the various cess and levies were subsumed under the GST.

### Drawbacks of NDMA, 2005
- Implementation is slow and slack
- Fostering a hierarchical, bureaucratic, command and control, 'top down', approach that gives the central, state, and district authorities sweeping powers.
- The CAG, 2013 report highlighted several other loopholes in the functioning of NDMA.
	- None of the major projects taken up by NDMA was complete. 
	- Several critical posts in NDMA were vacant and consultants were used for day to day working.
- Observations of Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on ‘Disaster Preparedness in India’.
	- NEC is supposed to meet once in three months, the committee met infrequently even when there had been disasters, such as the 2007 floods in West Bengal and the 2008 stampede in Rajasthan. 
	- The centre, states and districts had not constituted Mitigation Funds which could be utilised for disaster preparedness, restoration, etc.
	- Various projects undertaken for strengthening the communication networks for disaster management were either at the planning stage, or were delayed. 
	- 27% posts in the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were vacant.
## National Policy on Disaster Management, 2009
Focus on cohesive synergy among all stakeholders.
- Objectives:
	- Promoting prevention, preparedness & resilience at all levels through knowledge, innovation and education.
	- Encourage mitigation based on tech, traditional wisdom and sustainability.
	- Mainstreaming disaster management into developmental planning process.
## National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP), 2016
>India's NDMP is aligned broadly with goals and priorities set out in  **Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), 2015**, [[Sustainable Development Goals\|SDGs]] and [[Paris agreement\|Paris agreement]] (COP21). #introduction 
### Salient features are NDMP
- Planning: It has plans for short, medium and long run respectively 5, 10, and 15 years to deal with disasters.
- Approach focuses on 5 thematic areas of actions:
	- Understanding risk
	- Inter-agency coordination
	- Investing in DRR - structural measure
	- Investing in DRR - non-structural measure
	- Capacity building
- Integrated approach with role clarity: 
	- 15 different disasters have been identified and different ministers are entrusted for management. For instance for cyclone, Minister for earth science will be responsible. Beside union it offers role for state, districts, and panchayats also.
- Redefining disaster management: It also identifies major activities such as early warning, information dissemination, medical care, fuel, transportation, search and rescue, evacuation, etc. to serve as a checklist for agencies responding to a disaster.
- Human disasters: Human induced disasters like chemical, biological, radioactivity, and nuclear also covered under it.
- Besides human it focus on livestock and animals also.
- Media role: It calls for **ethical guidelines for the media** for coverage of disasters as well as self-regulation. 
	- The plan wants the media to respect the dignity and privacy of affected people. Also, in a move aimed to stop rumours and spread of panic, the plan directed the authorities to schedule regular media briefing.
- Awareness: To prepare communities to cope with disasters, it emphasises on a greater need for information, education and communication activities.
- International practise: Technical upgradation and adopting best international practice is part of it.
### It will help as
- Clarity of role for different stakeholders delivered by it which is very important at the time of crisis. Chaos can be largely avoided by ensuring single line of command.
- It identifies major aspects such as early warning, information dissemination, medical care, fuel, transportation, search and rescue and evacuation. This acts as a checklist of activities for agencies during the time of disaster.
- A regional approach has been mentioned, by clearly spelling out the roles and responsibilities of the local bodies. Local level planning would move the whole thing from one size fits all approach.
- Greater emphasis on IEC activities, which empowers and enables people to effectively cope with disasters.
- A model for Asian countries for upcoming ministerial event on disaster management in India.
###  Missing points
- Unlike Sendai Framework it does not set any goals or targets or a definite time frame. Fails to lay down a clear and practical roadmap.
- Further, a framework for funding is missing.
- Role of corporate bodies need to be institutionalised, which was not done.
- Inclusion of innovative methodologies with a judicious mix of new technology with traditional practices.
- ==Need to give space to disaster insurance provisions.==
- Few disasters are missing from the list of National disasters. e.g. Kerala requested Centre to notify [[coastal erosion\|coastal erosion]] as disaster. It is only a state specific disaster. 
	- Kerala planted Casuarina trees as bio-shields to protect coastal areas.

## Disaster Management Cycle in India
### Reducing Risk & Enhancing Resilience
- National Policy suggests multipronged approach:
	- Risk reduction measures in all development projects
	- Initiate mitigation projects in high priority areas through joint efforts.
	- Encourage and assist state level mitigation projects
	- Pay attention to indigenous knowledge on disaster & coping mechanisms
	- Give due weightage to protection of heritage structures.
- PM's ten point agenda on Disaster Risk Reduction
	- ![Pasted image 20220927134227.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220927134227.png)
### Disaster Preparedness & Response
- Preparedness: Knowledge & capacities developed by governments, organisations, communities and individuals to anticipate & respond to, recover from impacts pf likely, imminent hazard events.
- Institutional arrangement for response:
	- Nodal central ministries for national-level coordination
	- Central agencies for early warning systems & alerts.
	- NDRF
	- SDRF
- Relief measures: Relief can be delayed and often arrives in highly fragmented or uncoordinated forms with multiple organisations acting independently.
	- NDMA Guidelines on minimum standards of relief:
		- Pre-identification of location & buildings for relief shelters.
		- Special care & arrangements for women, elderly, children & disabled.
		- Minimum 2400 kcal/day to men and women and 3 litres of water per person/day.
		- Mobile medical teams should visit relief camps regularly.
		- Maintenance of hygiene and provision of clean water.
		- Death certificates within 15 days.
		- Relief centres should be temporary and closed as soon as normalcy returns.
- Fire & Emergency Services (FES): As first responders during golden hour of the disaster.
- As per NDMA guidelines there should be DM kits in each and every house of a high risk area.
### Disaster Risk Governance (DRG)
DRG is the way in which public authorities, civil servants, media, private sector & civil society cooperate to manage and reduce disaster risk.
- The Sendai Framework lays emphasis on the following to strengthen disaster risk governance:
	- Mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors. Transparency must be encouraged. 
	- Adopt and implement DRR strategies and plans, across different levels (local to national) and timescales to the strengthen resilience – economic, social, health and environmental.
	- Carry out assessment of disaster risk management capacity to deal with the identified risks at different levels
	- Promote necessary mechanisms and incentives to ensure high levels of compliance with the safety-enhancing provisions.
	- Periodically review and assess the progress on various DM plans as well as encourage institutional debates, including by parliamentarians and relevant officials, on DRR plans. Also establish grievance redressal mechanisms.
	- Assign clear roles and tasks to community representatives within disaster risk management.
	- Establish and strengthen government coordination forums at different levels.
	- Work with parliamentarians and other elected representatives for disaster risk reduction by developing or amending relevant legislation and setting budget allocations.
	- Promote the development of quality standards, such as certifications and awards for disaster risk management.

### Recovery & Build Back Better (BBB)
- Approach to re-construction and recovery in India is guided by the National Policy on DM, 2009. It states that:
	- Incorporating disaster resilient features to ‘build back better’ will be the guiding principle.
	- Reconstruction plans and designing of houses need to be a participatory process (government, affected community, NGOs & corporate sector. 
	- Essential services, social infrastructure and intermediate shelters/camps will be established in the shortest possible time.
	- Plans for reconstruction in highly disaster prone areas need to be drawn out during the period of normalcy.
- Recovery Process: Three recovery stages, in which appropriate policies and programmes tend to be planned and implemented are: a) Early, b) Mid-Term, and c) Long-Term
	- ![Pasted image 20220927193153.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220927193153.png)
- Major steps of recovery:
	- Post-disaster needs assessment -> developing a vision for BBB
	- Ensure coherence of BBB with development goals
	- Incorporating resilience in recovery vision
	- Balancing recovery across sectors (public & private)
	- Prioritising sectors for recovery as per relative importance.
- Reconstruction: Redeveloping & restoring socio-economic viability of disaster areas. These efforts includes:
	- Reconstruction of public infrastructure and social services in long term
	- Re-establishing adequate housing
	- Restoring jobs/livelihood - restoring economic base of disaster affected areas.
#### Rehabilitation
Strategy of institutional reforms and improvement of infrastructure and services aimed towards & supporting affected population. Rehabilitation includes physical, psychological, economic and social infrastructure.
##### Physical Rehabilitation
- Reconstruction of physical infrastructure such as buildings, railways, roads, communication network, water supply, electricity etc.
- Short-term and long-term strategies towards watershed management, canal irrigation, social forestry, crop stabilization, alternative cropping techniques, job creation, employment generation and environmental protection.
- Rehabilitation of agriculture, artisan work and animal husbandry.
- Adequate provision for subsidies, adherence to land-use planning, flood plain zoning, retrofitting or strengthening of undamaged houses, and construction of model houses.
- Relocation is a very sensitive part of the physical rehabilitation process and it must be ensured that need based considerations and not extraneous factors should drive the relocation policy. Relocation efforts should consider the following:
	- Avoid secondary displacement as far as possible.
	- Gain consent of the affected communities.
	- Clearly define land acquisition process.
	- Take into consideration urban/rural land use planning before moving ahead.
	- Provide customized relocation packages.
	- As far as possible, ensure relocation site is near to their sources of livelihood.
	- >Rehabilitation of human settlements is one of the important environmental impacts which always attract controversy while planning major projects. Discuss the measures suggested for mitigation of this impact while proposing major developmental projects. #PYMQ, 2016
##### Social Rehabilitation
- The vulnerable groups such as the artisans, elderly, orphans, single women and young children would need special social support to survive the impact of disasters. 
- Revival of Educational Activities:
	- Regular counselling to teachers and children.
	- Encourage children to attend the schools regularly.
	- Provide writing material, and work books to children.
	- Make children participate in all resurrection activities in the school.
	- Try to inculcate conducive attitudes to enable the students to play a positive role in self-development.
	- Establish village level education committees.
	- Identify local groups that could conduct smooth functioning of education activities.
- Rehabilitation of the Elderly, Women and Children
	- Identify familiar environments to rehabilitate elderly, women and children.
	- Organize regular counselling to strengthen the mental health of women and children.
	- Initiate various training programmes to make the women economically self-sufficient.
	- Give due attention to health, nutrition and hygiene in the long-term rehabilitation package for women and children.
	- Activate/reactivate the anganwadis (day-care centres), and old-age homes within the shortest possible time.
	- Set up at least one multi-purpose community centre per village.
	- Make efforts to build residential female children homes at the block level.
	- Set up vocational training camps to improve the skills of orphans and children
	- Promote [[Self Help Groups (SHGs)\|Self Help Groups (SHGs)]]
##### Economic Rehabilitation
- Livelihood restoration and ensuring the continuity of trade and commerce. Economic recovery should be based on:
	- Analysis of existing livelihood strategies and sustainability of businesses.
	- A comprehensive analysis of existing and future risks.
	- The vulnerabilities of the affected families.
	- The accessibility of linkages to external influences and institutions including skills and knowledge.
	- Access to functioning markets.
##### Psychological Rehabilitation
- Dealing with victim’s psychology is a very sensitive issue and must be dealt with caution and concern.  Efforts should be made to focus more on:
	- Psycho-therapeutic health programmes
	- Occupational therapy
	- Debriefing and trauma care
	- Tradition, values, norms, beliefs, and practices of disaster-affected people

### Capacity Development
- NIDM (in partnership with other research institutes) has capacity building as one of its major responsibilities.
- NDRF Academy (Nagpur): Premier institute; imparts high class training to NDRF & disaster response personnel of [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\|SAARC]] countries in disaster management. Also conducts course for Training of Trainers (ToT) & master trainers (MT) in different areas.
- Capacity development of local bodies: Elected leaders & officials should be trained to handle crises, contribute to preparedness, use available warnings, organise operations such as search, rescue, relief etc.
- Training Communities: Sendai Framework notes the need to build knowledge of civil society, communities & volunteers on disaster risk reduction. Capacity building include awareness, orientation & developing skills of communities and their leaders. 
	- Community is the first responder to disaster.
	- Kerala is planning start DM clubs in all schools. #example

# Multi-hazard phenomena
## Chamoli Disaster
- Chamoli disaster ([[GS 1/GEOGRAPHY/GEOPHYSICAL PHENOMENA/Floods#Flash floods\|Flash floods]]), following the break in Raunthi [[Glaciers\|Glaciers]] due to [[Avalanches\|Avalanches]] is an excellent example of multi-hazard phenomena, occurred during winter time. 
- No evidence of [[Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)\|Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)]] having caused the event. 
- Washed away Rishiganga Hydro electric project and  Tapovan project.
- Vishnugadh Pipalkoti Hydro Electric Project across Alaknanda river
- Uttarakhand is a part of lesser Himalaya - a region bounded by earth faults - remain active in terms of deep movement of rock assemblages.
- Main Central Thrust (MCT), where Indian and Eurasian plates connect runs along the east west of Himalayas. As a result of these geological stresses, weakens the rocks, making the development of large dams in the region unwise.
- Prof. Valdiya advocates for small low impact dams of less than 5 MW as an alternative.
- Repeated filling and emptying of the reservoir could result in induced seismic effects. Region fall within very high hazard zones for landslides.

## Joshimath sinking
- The Joshimath disaster is a [[land subsidence\|land subsidence]] event that has been ongoing since January 2023 in the town of Joshimath in Uttarakhand, India. The disaster has caused widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure, and has forced the evacuation of thousands of people.
- The cause of the disaster is still being investigated, but it is believed to be due to a combination of factors, including:
	- The extraction of groundwater from the region, which has lowered the water table and caused the ground to subside.
	- The construction of a large hydropower project in the area, which may have disrupted the natural drainage patterns and contributed to the subsidence.
	- The geology of the region, which is prone to landslides and other geological hazards.

The Joshimath disaster is a reminder of the risks of development in fragile mountain environments. It is also a call for action to address the issue of land subsidence, which is a growing problem in many parts of the world.
- The disaster began on January 2, 2023, when torrents of water gushed out of the lower slope of Joshimath.
- The water caused cracks to appear in buildings and roads, and some buildings collapsed.
- More than 700 houses and several roads have been damaged.
- As many as 200 families have been evacuated from the town.

The Joshimath disaster is a serious event that has had a devastating impact on the town and its residents. It is important to learn from this disaster and take steps to mitigate the risks of land subsidence in other parts of the world.

# International cooperation in DM and current developments
Udaipur Declaration in BRICS Disaster Management meeting. Emphasis on Flood management and meeting the challenges of enforcing DRR in future due to [[Global Warming\|Global Warming]] and [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]].
## [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\|SAARC]] Disaster Management Centre
- Established in 2010, in New Delhi


## Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)
- Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI): United States has announced its commitment as the founding member to the CDRI, whose headquarters will be located in India.
- US participation in CDRI is a significant development since the U.S. has considerable expertise in the area.
## Sendai framework
- The Sendai Framework is a 15 year (2015-30), **voluntary, non-binding agreement** which recognises that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders including local government, private sector and the other stakeholders.
### Four priorities
1. Understanding disaster risk in all its dimensions (vulnerability, capacity, knowledge, etc).
2. Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk at national, regional and global level.
3. Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience.
4. Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to **build back better** in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.
### Positives
1. It involves adopting integrated and inclusive institutional measures so as to work towards preventing vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery and strengthen resilience.
2. Enhanced work to reduce exposure and vulnerability, thus preventing the creation of new disaster risks.
3. Sendai disaster risk targets contribute to achieving sustainable development goals ([[Sustainable Development Goals\|SDGs]]).
4. International, regional and sub-regional cooperation inculcated.
5. Broader and a more people centered preventive approach to disaster risk reduction.
6. Involvement of private sector.
### Limitations
1. Voluntary commitments.
2. No specific targets.
3. Low financing commitments from the rich nations threaten to undercut the international community’s anti poverty agenda. Poor countries face increased levels of hidden costs and challenges to meet their obligations.
4. It does not discuss the disasters caused by ways of energy production.
5. It does not discuss the vulnerability of disaster refugees.

# Cyclones

</div>


## Cyclone disaster management
- New study published in *Science* shows that tropical cyclones are moving closer to land, making them more dangerous.
- By one estimate, 20 out of 23 major cyclone disasters in the world occurred around Bay of Bengal region.
- Increasing sea surface temperature and the geo-climatic conditions in India led to a rise in the frequency of devastating cyclones in the region.
### Preparedness
- Installation of early warning systems in coastal districts
- Construction of evacuation shelters in cyclone-prone areas.
- Plantation of [[Mangroves\|mangroves]] in coastal region to lessen the impact of cyclones
- Long term measures like building cyclone resilient infrastructure such as as storm surge resilient embankments, canals, disaster resilient power infrastructure and concrete houses to poor and vulnerable households, disallow use of tin sheets for buildings.
- How well India is prepared to handle cyclones depends on developing greater expertise on accurate forecasting, disaster mitigation, climate-proofing of lives and dwellings, ground mapping of vulnerabilities and crafting policies to increase resilience among communities. 
- It requires a multi-sectoral approach.
### Disaster rescue
- Vulnerable people must be evacuated and given shelter to minimise loss of lives.
- A stock of relief materials.


### Existing Challenges
- Inadequate respond to warnings stemming from lack of planning and coordination at the national and local levels, as well as a lack of understanding by people of their risks.
- Bare minimum the terminal-end equipment and communication back-up equipment support.
- Lack of grass root level participation in disaster management to build up effective resilience to disasters.
- Lack of a fully automated and state-of-the-art OC at NDMA and MHA with all terminal-end facilities and communication connectivity both for routine activities and also during disasters.
- The need for integration of networks set up by various agencies to establish various types of networks in the country for disaster management.
- Failure of even well-engineered structures such as communication and transmission towers past cyclones

# Floods
>The inundation of an area by water is called a flood. Floods have the greatest damage potential of all natural disasters world wider and affect greatest number of people. #definition #introduction 
-  Over 40 million hectares (12%) of its land is prone to floods and river erosion.
- The most flood prone areas are the [[Brahmaputra flood\|Brahmaputra]], Ganga and Indus basins. 
- The perennial flooding in north Bihar (Mithilanchal region) (76% population in Bihar faces recurring threat of flood devastation)
## Causes of floods
- Heavy rain in the catchment area of a river causes water to over flow its banks, which results in the flooding of nearby areas.
- River beds become shallow due to sedimentation. The water carrying capacity of such river is reduced.
- Due to deforestation, the land becomes obstruction free and water flows with greater speed into the rivers and causes flood.
- Cyclone generated sea waves of abnormal height spreads the water in the adjoining coastal areas. Large coastal areas are flooded by rising sea water, when a tsunami strikes the coast.
- Drainage congestion caused by badly planned construction of bridges, roads, railway tracks, canals etc. hampers the flow of water and the result is flood.
- Urban flooding due to heavy rainfall in a short period of time, concretisation, indiscriminate encroachment of waterways, inadequate capacity of drains, high [[Tides\|Tides]] in case of coastal cities.  e.g. Chennai floods, Mumbai floods.
## Consequences
- Frequent inundation of agricultural land and human settlement has serious consequences on the national economy and society.
- Floods do not only destroy valuable crops every year but these also damage physical infrastructure such as roads, rails, bridges and human settlements.
- Millions of people are rendered homeless and are also washed down along with their cattle in the floods.
- Spread of diseases like cholera, gastro-enteritis, hepatitis and other water-borne diseases spread in the flood-affected areas.
- Floods also make a few positive contributions. Every year, floods deposit fertile silt over agricultural fields which is good for the crops.
### Impact of floods on soil
- Soil degradation due to flooding is a serious concern. An estimated 14 million hectares of land suffer soil degradation due to flooding annually in India.
- After the 2009 floods in North Karnataka, 13 flood-hit districts lost lot of top soil.
## Different categories of floods
### Flash floods
>Flash floods are short-term events, occurring **within 6 hours of the causative event**. They are characterised by a rapid stream rise with depths of water that can reach well above the banks of the creek. #definition #introduction 
#### Impacts
- Flash flood damage and most fatalities tend to occur in areas immediately adjacent to a stream. 
- Additionally, heavy rain falling on steep terrain can weaken soil and cause mud slides, damaging homes, roads and property.
#### Causes of flash floods
1. Encroachment on the flood plains lead to flash flood.
2. Urban settlements on the areas through which water get back to the oceans of rivers or any other natural place.
3. Polluting elements like poly bags are also the reason which hinder the drainage systems. Unplanned waste dumping reduces the capacity of aquifers to recharge.
4. Building roads and concrete structures have left no place for water to get absorbed into soil.
5. [[Cloud burst\|Cloud burst]]
#### Measures to control flash floods
1. Wetlands, lakes which are lost in illegal construction must be reclaimed to be able function as water harvesting facilities.
2. Migrants should be provided decent housing. In the absence of which, they tend to settle along floodplains.
3. Vulnerable areas must be identified.
4. Hydraulic modelling of stormwater drains and placing sophisticated water pumps to pump out excess water.
5. Not allowing construction activity in ecologically fragile areas like floodplains etc. The recent issue of world cultural festival on the floodplains of Yamuna is a case in point.
6. To prevent damage during floods, resilience of cities must be increased by retrofitting critical infrastructure like schools, hospitals, water, electricity etc. so that they function even during emergencies. Customers must be alerted regarding property in hazardous areas.

### Urban floods
>Account for the huge flooding of million cities in India including the smart ones like Hyderabad and Pune. Suggest lasting remedial measures. (Answer in 250 words) 15 #PYMQ 

>The frequency of urban floods due to high intensity rainfall is increasing over the years. Discussing the reasons for urban floods, highlight the mechanisms for preparedness to reduce the risk during such events. #PYMQ, 2016

>Urban flooding is significantly different from rural flooding as urbanisation leads to developed catchments, which increases the flood peaks from 1.8 to 8 times and flood volumes by up to 6 times. Consequently, flooding occurs very quickly due to faster flow times. #introduction 
- Urban areas are densely populated and people living in vulnerable areas suffer due to flooding, sometimes resulting in loss of life. It is not only the event of flooding but the secondary effect of exposure to infection also has its toll in terms of human suffering, loss of livelihood and, in extreme cases, loss of life.
- Urban areas are also centres of economic activities with vital infrastructure which needs to be protected 24x7. In most of the cities, damage to vital infrastructure has a bearing not only for the state and the country but it could even have global implications.
- Major cities in India have witnessed loss of life and property, disruption in transport and power and incidence of epidemics. Most city areas around rivers are flooded during monsoon period. Mumbai floods in 2006 caused havoc in the whole city. Therefore, management of urban flooding has to be accorded top priority.
- Increasing trend of urban flooding is a universal phenomenon and poses a great challenge to urban planners the world over. Problems associated with urban floods range from relatively localised incidents to major incidents, resulting in cities being inundated from hours to several days.
- Therefore, the impact can also be widespread, including temporary relocation of people, damage to civic amenities, deterioration of water quality and risk of epidemics.
- Rehabilitation from vulnerable areas
- Proper drainage and housing (Lack of these aggravated Chennai floods in 2015 and 2021)
- Two parallel canals in cities can divert surplus water to water starved areas.
- Buffer stocking of food grains.
## Flood control measures
>In what way can flood be converted into a sustainable source of irrigation and all-weather inland navigation in India? #PYMQ     2017
- Identification and marking of flood prone areas on maps, preparation of close contour and flood vulnerability maps by the **Central Water Commission (CWC)**, etc.
- Implementation of the schemes for expansion and modernisation of the flood forecasting and warning network, execution of flood protection and drainage improvement schemes. The efforts of the CWC, IMD, NRSA and the state governments will be integrated.
- Implementation of activities, which include construction of dams and catchment area treatment (CAT) works in India as well as neighboring countries. But, dams built to control floods of Damodar could not control the flood.
- By building flood protection embankments, flood water can be controlled from overflowing the banks and spreading in nearby areas. Building of embankments on Yamuna, near Delhi, has been successful in controlling the flood.
- Flood Plain Zoning.
	- ![Pasted image 20220929075531.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929075531.png)
- Dredging the river basins and Inter-basin transfers of river water can reduce flood. e.g.  **Ini njan ozhukatte (let me flow) project** of Kerala for the Rejuvenation of water streams with people participation.
- The furry of flood could be minimised by planting trees in catchment areas of rivers.
- Drainage system is generally choked by the construction of roads, canals railway tracks etc. Floods could be checked if the original form of drainage system is restored.
- Flood education, emergency search and rescue and emergency relief. 
- More consultative decision making process in operations of large and medium dams that have an impact across state boundaries. This is important, the floods in Bihar can be attributed to release of waters from Bansagar dam, MP.
- A **nationwide silt management policy**. This can prevent the future floods of those types which took place in Bihar.
- Use of technology for advanced flood prediction. e.g. mobile app to update on the water level, rainfall data and risk possibilities on Meenachil river Kerala.
- Dutch "**room for river**" concept - to  live with water, build with nature and make room for the river - a project launched after two major floods in 1993 and 1995  to widen riverbanks and reshape the areas around rivers.
- Need for a higher degree of coordination between agencies and all levels of government.
- The warnings should be in local language and in simple terms.

## Floods in Brahmaputra 
>The Brahmaputra, one of the largest rivers of the world, has its ==origin in the Chemayungdung glacier of the Kailash range near the Mansarovar lake==. 
- Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river,  unstable in its entire reach in Assam except for a few places and well-known for floods, channel shifting and bank erosion. 
- This is due to the fact that most of its tributaries are large, and bring large quantity of sediments owing to heavy rainfall in its catchment area
- Additionally, the entire area falls in an earthquake-prone zone and experiences high rainfall. Landslides and earthquakes send in a lot of debris in the rivers, causing the river bed to rise and leading to floods

# Cloud burst
>A cloudburst is a sudden downpour within a radius of few kilometres. It usually lasts no longer than few minutes but is capable of flooding the area. This leads to flash floods, house collapse, dislocation of traffic and human casualties on large scale. #definition #introduction 

>With reference to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) guidelines, discuss the measures to be adopted to mitigate the impact of recent incidents of cloudbursts in many places of Uttarakhand. #PYMQ, 2016
## Conditions favourable
- Hilly areas are more prone to cloud burst. The topographical conditions like steep hills favour the formation of these clouds.
- And also the devastations, as water flowing down the steep slopes bring debris, boulders and uprooted trees with great velocity damaging any structure that comes in their way.
## Causes
- Most essential condition to develop a cloudburst is when the saturated clouds are unable to produce raindrops. This happens when strong vertical convectional currents are formed and they move upwards quickly, not letting the already formed raindrops to fall below.
- This helps in the formation of new drops and the existing ones grow bigger in size. This continues till the clouds are unable to hold the rain drops and they drown altogether in a quick flash. 
- Sudden dip in temperature coupled with enhanced electrostatic conduction as lightening gets trapped inside the cloud results in cloud burst.
- The form of precipitation is called Langmuir precipitation (heavy drops at an enhanced speed)
- This condition is facilitated in hilly areas when clouds get stuck in a narrow space between the hills and mountains.
## Impacts
- Flash floods leads to soil erosion and changes the structure of Landform. They also wash away the houses, properties of the people.
- Landslides prominent in hilly areas blocks transportation routes like roads.
- Cloudbursts in plain areas leads to water logging and inundation thus damaging crops.
- Business activities are hampered when offices, restaurants and shops are washed away.

## Management of cloudbursts
- Doppler radar should be used to predict heavy rainfall due to cloud bursting.
- Proper maintenance of drainage
- Avoid settlements in disaster prone area, particularly on slopes.

# Drought
>Drought refers to a situation where the available water (through rainfall, surface water or groundwater) falls short of the demand for extended periods of time due to inadequate precipitation, excessive rate of evaporation and over utilisation of water from the reservoirs and other storages, including the ground water. #definition #introduction 
- 68% of India's cultivable area is vulnerable to droughts
- ![Pasted image 20220929080507.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929080507.png)
## Reasons for drought
- India receives major portion of precipitation from Southwest monsoon, which gets affected by dynamics such as El Nino and [[Climate Change\|climate change]].
- Overuse of surface and groundwater due to perverse incentives in favour of cash crops and overuse.
- Lack of water harvesting technologies.
- Lack of irrigation facilities. Almost 65% agricultural lands in India are not irrigated.
## Impact of drought
- Droughts cause scarcity of food and water. People die of hunger, malnutrition and epidemics.
- People are forced to migrate from their area of residence.
- Scarcity of water compels people to consume contaminated water resulting in spread of many waterborne diseases like gastroenteritis, cholera, hepatitis, etc.
- Cattle die because fodder and water are not easily available.
- Farmers are deprived of their employment.
- People leave their villages with their families for a long, unknown and uncertain journey in the pursuit of food, water, green fodder and employment.
## Measures to be taken
### Short-term measures
- Rationing of water, drinking water kiosks in Kerala, prioritisation of water use, water trains during Marathwada drought.
- Provision of funds under disaster management act to mitigate immediate losses and also mobilising district disaster committees.
- Provision of additional working days (increased from 100 to 150) in MNREGA scheme. This provision saw increased demand in drought-hit states.
- New farm insurance scheme Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has been launched by the Govt. Revising norms for crop loss as well as extension of interest subvention schemes for the farmers.
- Distribution of safe drinking water, medicines for the victims and availability of fodder and water for the cattle and shifting of the people and their livestock to safer places.
- Drought Toolbox 
### Long-term measures
- Better forecasting of drought by IMD through newer forecasting models using supercomputers (Coupled Forecast System v2, dynamical model).
- Water management is the most crucial long-term step for fighting drought. Rejuvenation of local water bodies and construction of water tanks (Jalyukt Shivar in Maharashtra, Mission Kakatiya in Telangana respectively).
- By making high bunds around the fields, adoption of terrace cultivation, planting trees on the bunds of fields, the use of rainwater can be maximised. Water can also be conserved by taming the irrigation canals with mortar and bricks.
- Increasing the awareness regarding water intensive crops, cultivation of millets, soil health and the judicious use of groundwater. Advance drought warnings through m-Kisan portals.
- [[Inter-linking of river(s)\|Inter-linking of river(s)]] basins to shift water from surplus basins to deficit basins (Polavaram project, Ken-Betwa link).
- Collection of each and every drop of rain could help in coping with the drought.
- Increasing research in drought-resistant Genetically Modified (GM) crops. Increasing the research focus towards cloud-seeding and other measures to augment precipitation.
- Increasing the adoption of storm-water drains in cities, as well as increasing the green cover by properly implementing projects such as Green India Mission (GIM) and funds from the Compensatory Afforestation Fund.
- Livelihood planning identifies those livelihoods which are affected by the drought. Some of such livelihoods include increased off-farm employment opportunities, collection of non timber forest produce from the community forests, raising goats, carpentry etc.

Droughts occur due to natural causes but they are aggravated due to human actions. The initiatives taken by the government are good in intention but suffer from lack of proper implementation and focus. Earnest support to the aforementioned measures can help alleviate the ill-effects of droughts to a great extent.

## Flash drought
>Flash droughts are those that occur very quickly, with soil moisture depleting rapidly. Drought conditions develop within a week or two. #definition 
- India faced flash drought in 1979, affecting 40% of the country, suffered a loss of about 5,000 crores.
### Factors 
- Atmospheric anomalies like [[El Nino\|El Nino]], [[Southern Oscillation\|Southern Oscillation]],
- Anthropogenic [[Greenhouse gas\|Greenhouse gas]] emission
- [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]]
### Solutions
- We should meet [[Paris agreement\|Paris agreement]] goals to reduce the numbers and frequency of projected flash droughts.
- Use of community earth models for prediction.

# Tsunami
>Tsunami originate because of rapid displacement of water from the lake, sea or ocean. The displaced ocean water rushes back in the form of large waves thus surging over land with great destructive power. #definition #introduction 
- Tsunamis are frequently observed along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire\|Pacific ring of fire]], particularly along the coast of Alaska, Japan, Philippines, and other islands of South east Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and India etc.
- Close to 5,700 kms, out of the 7,516 kms long coastline of India is prone to cyclones and tsunamis.
## Why impact is more near the coast ?
- The speed of wave in the ocean depends upon the depth of water. It is more in the shallow water than in the ocean deep. So, the impact of tsunami is less over the ocean and more near the coast.
- Therefore, a ship at sea is not much affected by tsunami and it is difficult to detect a tsunami in the deeper parts of sea. Thus, these are also called **Shallow water waves**.
## Causes
- ==Fault movements on the sea floor, accompanied by an [[GS 1/GEOGRAPHY/GEOPHYSICAL PHENOMENA/EARTHQUAKE\|earthquake]].== They release huge amount of energy and have the capacity to cross oceans.
- ==[[Landslides\|Landslides]]== either occurring under water or originating above the sea and then plunging into the water. ==The largest tsunami ever produced by a landslide was in Lituya Bay, Alaska 1958==.
- [[VOLCANIC ACTIVITY\|Volcanic activity]]. In 1883, the violent explosion of the famous volcano, **Krakotoa** in Indonesia, produced tsunami measuring 40 meters which crushed upon Java and Sumatra. Also, ==80% Tsunamis in Pacific ocean are result of volcanism==.
- ==Meteorites from the outer space also result in the Tsunami waves.==
- Sea mining, underwater explosion.
## Tsunami warning
![Pasted image 20220929074818.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220929074818.png)
### International Tsunami Warning Systems: 
- Shortly after the Hilo Tsunami (1946), the **Pacific Tsunami Warning System (PTWS)** was developed with its operational center near Honolulu, Hawaii. 
- The PTWC is able to alert countries several hours before the tsunami strikes. 
- The warning includes predicted arrival time at selected coastal communities where the tsunami could travel in few hours. A tsunami watch is issued with subsequent arrival time to other geographic areas.
### Regional Warning Systems: 
- Usually use seismic data about nearby earthquakes to determine if there is a possible local threat of a tsunami. 
- Such systems are capable enough to provide warnings to the general public in less than 15 minutes.
- Survey of India maintains a ==tide gauge network along the coast of India==.
	- The gauges are located in major ports of India. 
	- The day-to-day maintenance of the gauge is carried with the assistance from authorities of the ports.
- Apart from the tide gauge, tsunami can be detected with the help of radars. But radars take long time to process information.
## Possible risk reduction measures
- Japan has implemented an extensive programme of building ==tsunami walls== of up to 4.5m (13.5 ft) high in front of populated coastal areas. Other localities have built ==flood gates and channels to redirect the water from incoming tsunamis.==
- ==The designation and zoning of tsunami hazard areas== for such open-space uses as agriculture, parks and recreation. This strategy is designed to keep development at a minimum in hazard areas.
- Development of Disaster Information Management System (DIMS) in all the coastal states.
- ==[[Mangroves\|Mangrove forests]] and planting rows of tress on coasts act as an efficient barrier.==
- Control of sea mining as Mining of sand and other minerals from the sea, as is done in Kanyakumari, makes the concerned area highly vulnerable to tsunamis. The ==sand deposited on the sea floor absorbs much energy of the waves.==
- Most of the habitation of the fishing community is seen in the coastal areas. The houses constructed by them are mainly of light weight materials without any engineering inputs. So, people should be educated about the good construction practices that they should adopt.
- Use of traditional and indigenous knowledge in Tsunami management (Jarwa Tribes)
- Establishment of National Disaster Management Communication Network with a separate bandwidth.

# Heat Waves
>A Heatwave is a period of abnormally high temperatures, more than the normal maximum temperature that occurs during the summer season. In India, Heatwaves typically occur between March and June, and in some rare cases even extend till July. #definition #introduction 
- 2015-2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. 
- Following criteria are used to declare heat wave:
	- Based on Departure from Normal:
		- Heat Wave: temperature Departure from normal is 4.5°C to 6.4°C.
		- Severe Heat Wave: temperature Departure from normal is >6.4°C.
	- Based on Actual Maximum Temperature (for plains only):
		- Heat Wave: When actual maximum temperature ≥ 45°C.
		- Severe Heat Wave: When actual maximum temperature ≥47°C
### Causes 
- Impact of dry winds like loo
	-  
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Loo is very strong in the months of May and June. Due to its very high temperatures, exposure to it often leads to fatal heatstroke. 

</div></div>

- [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]] is driving temperatures higher as well as increasing the frequency and severity of heat waves in India.
- Delayed arrival of southwest Monsoon
- [[Urban Heat Island effect\|Urban Heat Island effect]] in cities are exacerbating the impact of heatwaves.

### Impacts 
- 660 heat waves across India in the last 2 decades caused 12,273 deaths.
-
-
-
-
-

**Health Impacts of Heat Waves**

The health impacts of Heat Waves typically involve dehydration, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and/or heat stroke. The signs and symptoms are as follows:

-   Heat Cramps: Ederna (swelling) and Syncope (Fainting) generally accompanied by fever below 39°C i.e.102°F.
-   Heat Exhaustion: Fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps and sweating.
-   Heat Stoke: Body temperatures of 40°C i.e. 104°F or more along with delirium, seizures or coma. This is a potential fatal condition

**Recover and Build**

**If you think someone is suffering from the heat:**

-   Move the person to a cool place under the shade
-   Give water or a rehydrating drink (if the person is still conscious)
-   Fan the person
-   Consult a doctor if symptoms get worse or are long lasting or the person is unconscious
-   Do not give alcohol, caffeine or aerated drink
-   Cool the person by putting a cool wet cloth on his/her face/body
-   Loosen clothes for better ventilation

**Emergency Kit**

-   Water bottle
-   Umbrella/ Hat or Cap / Head Cover
-   Hand Towel
-   Hand Fan
-   Electrolyte / Glucose / Oral Rehydration

# Heat wave: Do's & Dont's

**Heat Wave conditions** can result in physiological strain, which could even result in death.

To minimise the impact during the heat wave and to prevent serious ailment or death because of heat stroke, you can take the following measures:

-   Avoid going out in the sun, especially between 12.00 noon and 3.00 p.m.
-   Drink sufficient water and as often as possible, even if not thirsty
-   Wear lightweight, light-coloured, loose, and porous cotton clothes. Use protective goggles, umbrella/hat, shoes or chappals while going out in sun.
-   Avoid strenuous activities when the outside temperature is high. Avoid working outside between 12 noon and 3 p.m.
-   While travelling, carry water with you.
-   Avoid alcohol, tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks, which dehydrates the body.
-   Avoid high-protein food and do not eat stale food.
-   If you work outside, use a hat or an umbrella and also use a damp cloth on your head, neck, face and limbs
-   Do not leave children or pets in parked vehicles
-   If you feel faint or ill, see a doctor immediately.
-   Use ORS, homemade drinks like lassi, torani (rice water), lemon water, buttermilk, etc. which helps to re-hydrate the body.
-   Keep animals in shade and give them plenty of water to drink.
-   Keep your home cool, use curtains, shutters or sunshade and open windows at night.
-   Use fans, damp clothing and take bath in cold water frequently.

**TIPS FOR TREATMENT OF A PERSON AFFECTED BY A SUNSTROKE:**

-   Lay the person in a cool place, under a shade. Wipe her/him with a wet cloth/wash the body frequently. Pour normal temperature water on the head. The main thing is to bring down the body temperature.
-   Give the person ORS to drink or lemon sarbat/torani or whatever is useful to rehydrate the body.
-   Take the person immediately to the nearest health centre. The patient needs immediate hospitalisation, as heat strokes could be fatal.

**Acclimatisation**

People at risk are those who have come from a cooler climate to a hot climate. You may have such a person(s) visiting your family during the heat wave season. They should not move about in open field for a period of one week till the body is acclimatized to heat and should drink plenty of water. Acclimatization is achieved by gradual exposure to the hot environment during heat wave.

>Landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides are a type of "mass wasting" which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity. #definition #introduction 
- As per Geological Survey of India (GSI), about 0.42 million km2 covering nearly ==12.6% of land area of our country is prone to landslide hazards.==
- World's top two landslide hotspots exist in India: the southern edge of the Himalayan arc, and the coast along south-west India where the [[Western Ghats\|Western Ghats]] are situated.
- Besides these two regions, the North-eastern hill ranges, the Eastern Ghats and the Vindhyas are affected by Land slides.
- In India, debris [[Avalanches\|avalanche]] and landslides occur very frequently in the Himalayas.
## Causes
- Natural
	- [[GS 1/GEOGRAPHY/GEOPHYSICAL PHENOMENA/EARTHQUAKE\|EARTHQUAKE]] or [[VOLCANIC ACTIVITY\|VOLCANIC ACTIVITY]] may loosen rocks and start off a landslide.
	- Often landslides are caused by the lubricating action of rain water, prolonged spell of rain.
	- Highly weathered rock layers
- Anthropogenic
	- Artificial steepening of slopes, for road or rail cutting.
   - Mining or quarrying.
	- Clearing of natural vegetation for housing or agriculture - [[Soil erosion\|Soil erosion]]
### Why Himalayas are prone
>“The Himalayas are highly prone to landslides.” Discuss the causes and suggest suitable measures of mitigation. #PYMQ      2016

>Bring out the causes for more frequent landslides in the Himalayas than in Western Ghats. #PYMQ 2013
- Natural reasons
	- The Himalayas are tectonically active. Drifting of Indian plate causes frequent earth quakes and resultant instability.
	- They are mostly made up of sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated and semi-consolidated deposits.
	- The slopes are very steep.
	- Heavy snow fall in winter and melting in summer induces debris flow, which is carried in large quantity by numerous streams and rivers.
- Anthropogenic
	- [[Shifting cultivation\|Shifting cultivation]] in [[Development of North East\|North-east]].
	- [[The problem of ageing dams in India\|Dams]].
	- Tourism.
	- Grazing in highlands.
### Less frequent in Western Ghats
- Less occurrence of earth quakes because they’re on more stable part of Indian plate.
- While steep slope on western side with high rainfall creates ideal condition for landslide but gentle eastern slope with low rainfall and rivers in senile stage, does not.
## Impact 
### Short term impacts:
- Loss of natural beauty 
- Roadblocks, destruction of railway lines 
- channel blocking due to rock-falls 
- diversion of river courses due to landslides causing flood and 
- Loss of life and property
### Long term impacts:
- Changes in the landscape that can be permanent, 
- the loss of cultivable land
- the environmental impact in terms of erosion and soil loss, 
- population shift and relocation of populations and establishments
- drying up of sources of water
## Mitigation
- The problem needs to be tackled for mitigation and management for which hazard zones have to be identified and specific slides to be stabilized and managed in addition to monitoring and early warning systems to be placed at selected sites.
- It is always advisable to adopt area specific measures to deal with landslides. **Hazard mapping** should be done to locate areas commonly prone to landslides.
- **Restriction on the construction** and other developmental activities such as roads and dams, limiting agriculture to valleys and areas with moderate slopes, and control on the development of large settlements in the high vulnerability zones, should be enforced.
- A study of recent landslides and their causes should be conducted.
- Construction of parallel concrete walls to check soil erosion.
- Promote large scale afforestation programmes and construction of bunds to reduce the flow of water.
- Terrace farming should be encouraged in the northeastern hill states replacing Jhum or shifting cultivation.
- Retaining walls can be built of mountain slopes to stop land from slipping.

# Earthquake

</div>


## Earthquake as a disaster
### Seismic zones in India
- ==58.6 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity==. #introduction #facts 
- Himalayan range: The Himalayan range consisting of regions in J&K, North East, Uttarakhand Bihar etc. 
	- ==These regions being on the border of the tectonic plate, are very much vulnerable to the Earthquakes==. 
	- Seismic zoning map identified these areas as zone 4 and 5 indicating high vulnerability.
	- **Bhuj area in Gujarat** comes under this zone though it is ==prone to intra-plate earthquake unlike Himalayan region.==
- Indo-Gangetic plain: Delhi (Rohila fault line pass through Delhi), some regions of Kashmir and Maharashtra are in zone 4.
- [[Andaman & Nicobar Islands\|Andaman & Nicobar Islands]]: These islands are of volcanic origin and hence are prone to Earthquakes due to volcanism. They are identified as zone 5 region.
- [[Western Ghats\|Western Ghats]]: This region comes under zone 3 of the seismic zoning map. Being **block mountains**, there are fault planes across this region making the region susceptible to earthquakes.

Vulnerability of these regions are enhanced by construction of dams and reservoirs, non-adherence of seismic norms and exploitation of groundwater (act as an absorber of seismic waves)

### Distribution of Earthquakes across the world
- Coincides very closely with that of volcanoes. 70% of the earthquakes occur at Circum-Pacific belt.
- Another 20% in the Mediterranean - Himalayan belt. 

### Consequences
#### Landforms:
- Ground shaking, differential ground settlement, land and mud slides, soil liquefaction, ground lurching and [[Avalanches\|Avalanches]]
#### Damage of property:
- When earthquake occurs, buildings are greatly damaged. Underground pipelines and railway lines are damaged or broken. Dams on river collapse, resultant [[GS 1/GEOGRAPHY/GEOPHYSICAL PHENOMENA/Floods\|Floods]] cause havoc.
#### Human loss:
- Duration of tremors of earthquake is normally of only few seconds, but thousands of people may die in this short period.
#### Tsunamis:
- Earthquakes can often result in tsunamis. 
- It wreaks havoc on settlement of coastal areas.
#### Fountains of mud:
- Due to the intense impact of earthquake, hot water and mud appear on the surface and take a form of fountains.
- In Bihar earthquake of 1934, the fields of farmer were covered by knee-deep mud and the crops were destroyed.
### Mitigation and adaptation measures
- ==Establish earthquake monitoring centres== (seismological centres) for regular monitoring and fast dissemination of information among the people in the vulnerable areas. Alert systems as in USA, Japan and Taiwan.
	- geo-neutrinos can be used to identify earthquakes as their characteristics are changed during geological upheavals. 
- Preparing a ==vulnerability map of the country== and dissemination of vulnerability risk information among the people and educating them about the ways and means minimising the adverse impacts of disasters.
- ==Community preparedness is very vital for mitigating earthquake impact==. The most effective way to save you even in a slightest shaking is DROP, COVER and HOLD. It can be created through sensitisation and training programme for community, architects, engineers, builders, masons, teachers, government functionaries teachers and students.
- The Bureau of Indian Standards ==(BIS) has published building codes== and guidelines for safe construction of buildings against earthquakes. Building plans have to be compulsorily checked by the municipality.
- Architectural and engineering inputs need to be put together to improve building design and construction practices. The ==soil type needs to be analysed before construction==. Building structures on soft soil should be avoided.
	- 2 techniques for earthquake resistant buildings - Base Isolation Method (separation of building from surface using cylinders, springs and ball bearings), Vibration Dampeners (viscous liquid or carbon fibers to absorb seismic waves - in future [[Meta-Materials\|Meta-Materials]] can be used)
- In relief operations [[Drone technology\|Drones]] can be used.
- A ==[[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\|SAARC]] seismological agency needs to be set up==. This should be independent of the member countries meteorological departments and keep all member-states informed of seismicity’s as regularly as the MET office informs us about the weather. - ==An earthquake plan for the Himalayas needs to be drawn up==. Details need to be worked out on how rescue and relief operations can be conducted by air, land and water, in rough weather conditions and elusive terrains.
- The ==sites for all large dams and nuclear installations in the region need to be reevaluated from a seismic point of view==.

### Critical Existing Challenges for Earthquake Mitigation in India
- Inadequate enforcement of earthquake-resistant building codes and town planning bye-laws; 
	- #### Gujarat allowed to build Skyscrapers 
		- Gujarat allowed to build Skyscrapers - current limit is 70m. It will bring more FDI, an Urban landscape.
		- Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar are not far from the **Cambay fault**, and buildings in seismically active Kutch are not allowed more than one floor. 
		- All buildings will have to follow the **National Building Code** which lays down design guidelines for construction in seismically active zones.
		- Tall structures have to consider the horizontal load - how it will behave in an earthquake and the wind-load and the static load, which is the building’s own weight and occupancy load.
- Absence of earthquake-resistant features in constructions in urban and rural areas.
- Lack of formal training among professionals in earthquake-resistant construction practices.
- Lack of adequate preparedness and poor response capacity of various stakeholder groups.
- Lack of awareness among various stakeholders about the seismic risk;
- Absence of systems of licensing of engineers and masons.

>The frequency of earthquakes appears to have increased in the Indian subcontinent. However, India’s preparedness for mitigating their impact has significant gaps. Discuss various aspects. #PYMQ, 2015

# Forest Fire
>Forest fire is defined as unclosed fire responsible for depletion of natural resources. When forest fire goes out of control, it is called wildfire.
## Causes
### Natural causes of forest fire
- High atmospheric temperatures and dryness caused due to low humidity can cause a fire.
- [[Lightening\|Lightening]] due to thunderstorms.
- In dry seasons due to friction by rolling stones in the mountainous areas can cause spark.
- In bamboo areas, by the rubbing together of clumps of dry bamboos.
- Volcanic eruptions.
### Anthropogenic causes of forest fire
- [[Shifting cultivation\|Shifting cultivation]] where farmers put fire to the field to clear of vegetation and also to add organic matter to the soil.
- Villagers burn leaves and grass in order to get better growth of grass the following year. They also burn the needles of the chir pine, which form a slippery carpet on the ground.
- To facilitate collection of non-timber forest produce, collectors ignite fire which accidentally spread in the forest. For example, in the Terai region, honey collectors often start fires to drive away bees.
- For concealing the illicit felling.
- Careless throwing of bidi stubs, cigarettes, etc., by people working in the forests and villagers. Camp fires during winter.
## Impacts
### Benefits of wildfire
- Wildfires are sometimes a natural process, and help forests by promoting flowering, branching and seedling establishment. Fires that are limited to the surface may help in the natural regeneration of forests.
- The heating of the soil may result in helpful microbial activity, and hasten decaying processes that are useful for the vegetation.
## Policies and methods followed in India
- In India there are no separate department for wildfires and the regular forest department staff carries out the activities of forest fire management.
- One-size-fits-all approach of fire protection is incompatible with the ecology of India’s tropical dry forests.
- Forest management still suffers from a colonial hangover intent on keeping production forestry systems free from fire despite loss of stock.
- No-fire policy which leads to the spread of alien invasive species like Lantana Camara.
## How to manage forest fire
- Frequent burning of biomass (controlled fire) at regular intervals. 
	- The method of counter fire too is being adopted with forest officials starting fires from the opposite end of a forest to check the flames at a defined boundary. Scientific waste management techniques to avoid fires due to methane gas evolution, like the one happened in Deonar, Mumbai.
- Construction of narrow lanes in the forest, at crucial junctions, to restrict forest fires.
- Planting of broad tree leaves in forests, and after a period of five years, systematic replacement of chir pine trees in forests by broad leaves.
- Procurement of sweeping machines to clear roadsides of chir pine needles and dry leaves in vulnerable areas. Advocated large scale incentives and programmes under [[MGNREGA\|MGNREGA]] to collect pines for use as fuel, and other incineration.
- A dedicated toll free number for reporting incidents of forest fire in each state. Use of corporate social responsibility funds for creating awareness campaigns on forest fires. Ex: Not carrying match boxes.
- More modern systems of fire monitoring alongside traditional methods like maintaining fire lines, so there is a clearing between two forests to prevent the fire from spreading from one to the other. e.g., The use of MODIS sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to get real-time fire information of fire hotspots.
- Ministry should train fire brigade officers of all states and equip them with forest fire equipment so that in the event of forest fires they do not have to depend on outside agencies like NDRF.
- Creation of ponds and other water harvesting structures within the forest area to not only reduce river bank erosion but also as a handy tool for supply of water to douse forest fires.
- [[Cloud Seeding\|Cloud Seeding]] can be done to curb forest fire.

# Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)
>Glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a sudden release of a significant amount of water retained in a glacial lake, irrespective of the cause. #definition #introduction 
- Glacial lakes are ice-dammed, moraine-dammed, and bedrock-dammed lakes. These lakes are formed by the trapping of melt water from the glacier within dammed structure.
- Due to incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, wood and other fuels, the amount of black carbon is increasing in atmosphere, which once get deposited on glaciers or ice sheets reduces the albedo of glaciers/ice sheets and accelerates the rate of melting of the glaciers.
- National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has prepared guidelines for management of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) these include Hazard and risk mapping, Monitoring, risk reduction and mitigation measures, Awareness and preparedness.

# Chemical disasters
>Chemical disasters occur due to leakage of poisonous gas, explosion in the plant, improper transportation of chemicals and waste management.

## Measures
- Trained workforce and inventory of equipments should be maintained.
- Well establishment of communication networks.
- Transportation of chemicals in leakproof containers and wagons.
- Uncongested roads near industrial areas.
- Prevention of Urban Sprawl near industrial areas.
- Medical teams trained in handling of toxic chemicals should be maintained in industries.

## Bhopal gas tragedy, 1984
- License given to company for making of methyl isocyanate (MIC) based pesticide at their Bhopal facility overridden opposition from officials in the Ministry of Industrial Development.
- UCC was allowed to hold majority stakes in UCIL departing from legislation meant to curb monopolistic growth.
- The corporation was licensed and permitted storage and production of
- MIC in the midst of populated communities and worker’s repeated demands for relocation of the factory and implementation of occupational safety laws were consciously ignored.
- Officials were aware of the obsolete, discarded technology and faulty machinery being transferred to India but they never voiced against this and remained silent, if they would have taken stand against this, disaster could have not happened.
- Bail given to Anderson on a amount of mere 25000 rupees and was provided safe transit to Delhi and then to US by the Government officials where he died in luxury while victims were in agony, shows the complicity between Government and Corporate.
- Flawed calculation of number of victims and settlement amount based on this, with UCC and US, which have given no relief in terms of money. 
- Post-disaster investigations would show the flouting and circumvention of several regulations by the Indian government, including the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and safety norms that had set the stage for the disaster.

- e.g. 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Foremost challenge of Nuclear technology is **safety and waste management**. Incidents like Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011) are serious cause of concern. If nuclear energy is generated adhering to the highest standards of safety, there is less possibility of catastrophic accidents. 

</div></div>

## Measures
- Dry Cask Storage should be used for disposal of radio active waste.
- Establishment of more safe and modern reactors like European Pressurised Reactors (EPR). e.g. Jaitapur in MH (under construction)
- Avoid reactors in high risk areas like seismic zones.
- Maintenance of reactor and reprocessing of spent fuel in accordance with guidelines of [[International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\|International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]]
