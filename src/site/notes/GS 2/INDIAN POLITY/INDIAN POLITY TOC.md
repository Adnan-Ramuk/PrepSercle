# INDIAN POLITY
- Polity refers to the form or structure of government and political organization within a state or society. It encompasses the political institutions, processes, and systems that define how power is distributed and exercised. 
	- Polity includes not only the formal government structures but also the informal and non-state actors that shape the political landscape. 
- Indian polity works within the framework of the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/CONSTITUTION BOC\|Indian Constitution]].

- Constitution is a document that enjoys special legal sanctity. It contains principles and functions of the organs and elements of a State.
- [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/STATE/STATE BOC\|State]] is a political entity that has sovereignty over a specific territory and population. It is a legal and political concept that defines the boundaries of a country and its institutions, including the government, courts, and military.

- Therefore, while a state is a specific legal and political entity with defined borders and institutions, polity is a broader concept that encompasses the entire political system and organization within that state.
