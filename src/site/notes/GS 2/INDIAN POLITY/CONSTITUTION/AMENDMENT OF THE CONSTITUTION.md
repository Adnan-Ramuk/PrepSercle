# 1st Amendment-1951
The First Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1951. It made several changes to the Fundamental Rights provisions of the Indian constitution, including:
- Introducing a new exception to the right to freedom of expression: "public order" - This means that the government can restrict freedom of expression if it is necessary to maintain public order.
	- First amendment to the Indian [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/CONSTITUTION BOC\|Constitution]] put restrictions on 'freedom of speech and expression', while first amendment to the US Constitution made the freedom of speech and expression an absolute right.
- Adding the [[9th SCHEDULE\|9th Schedule]] to the Constitution, which lists laws that are not subject to judicial review - Article 31 B - holds that a legislation incorporated in the 9th Schedule is not subject to [[Judicial review\|Judicial review]]
	-

		- Right to property was enshrined as fundamental right under article 19 and 31. The provinces passed the Zamindari Abolition Acts but all these acts were challenged in the court on account of their constitutional validity. The supreme court upheld the rights of Zamindars. To secure the constitutional validity of these state acts, the parliament passed [[1st Amendment\|first amendment]] (1951) within 15 months of enactment of the constitution and second amendment in 1959. 

</div></div>

- Adding special provisions in favour of "socially and educationally backward classes"  - Article 15(4).
	- It allowed the government to make reservations for these groups in educational institutions to promote their advancement and upliftment.

>The First Amendment was a significant change to the Fundamental Rights provisions of the Indian constitution. It gave the government more power to restrict freedom of expression and it made it more difficult to challenge laws that violate the Fundamental Rights. These amendments have also played a vital role in shaping India's legal and social landscape. #conclusion

This change meant that the government could acquire private property for public purposes without paying compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Extension of Emergency Provisions**     | This Act extended the operation of the internal Emergency imposed by the 42nd Amendment. The amendment changed the term "Internal Disturbance" to "Armed Rebellion" for the declaration of Emergency under Article 352. It also made it mandatory for the President to act on the written advice of the Council of Ministers. The President's discretion to revoke the Emergency was also curtailed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Scope of Judicial Review**              | This Act amended Article 368 to exclude any amendment made under Article 368 from the scope of judicial review. It sought to restrict the Supreme Court's power to review constitutional amendments made by Parliament. However, the Supreme Court later held that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is not unlimited and that it cannot destroy or abrogate the "basic structure" of the Constitution. The "basic structure" doctrine was established in the Kesavananda Bharati case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

- The 44th Constitutional Amendment Act provides that, “As a further check against the misuse of the Emergency provisions and to put the right to life and liberty on a secure footing, it would be provided that  the power to suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of a fundamental right cannot be  exercised in respect of the fundamental right to life and liberty. The right to liberty is further strengthened by the provision that a law for preventive detention cannot authorise, in any case, detention for a longer period than two months, unless an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention. An additional safeguard would be provided by the requirement that the Chairman of an Advisory Board shall be a serving Judge of the appropriate High Court and that the Board shall be constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief Justice of that High Court.” Here the appropriate High Court refers to,
	- For a person detained by the order of Government of India it is the High Court of the Union territory of Delhi. For a person detained by the order of Government of any State (other than a Union territory), it is the High Court for that State. For a person detained by the order of the administrator of a Union territory, it is the High Court as may be specified by or under any law made by Parliament. The date for the substitution of this provision under article 22 is yet to be notified by the Government.
