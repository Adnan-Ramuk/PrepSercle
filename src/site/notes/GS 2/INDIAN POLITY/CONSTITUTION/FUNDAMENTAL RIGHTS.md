# FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
>Rights are claims of an individual on an authority. Rights which are guaranteed and specially protected under the constitution are called Fundamental rights. #introduction #definition 
- In constitutional law, the **presumption of constitutionality** is the **legal principle** that the judiciary should presume statutes enacted by the legislature to be constitutional unless the law is clearly unconstitutional or a fundamental right is implicated.
{ #d9843b}

- Parliament shall have (and the legislature of a state shall not have) powers to make laws for prescribing punishment for those acts that are declared to be offenses under the fundamental rights.

## Principles of Natural Justice
1. No one is the judge of his/her own case.
>Recusal means the withdrawal of a judge, prosecutor, or juror from a case on the grounds that they are unqualified to perform legal duties because of a possible conflict of interest or lack of impartiality. It is left to the discretion of a judge and not removed by any authority.
2. No one to be punished on unheard.
3. An authority while acting, must act in an unbiased manner.

# Judicial interpretations have expanded the scope of rights in many aspects
- In the context of various judicial decisions under Articles 32, 226, and others, fundamental rights and legal rights of individuals have been significantly strengthened.
- The concept of natural justice has assumed a paramount position in every judicial ruling, ensuring that no right can be violated without consequence. Judicial interpretations of fundamental rights, such as Articles 20, 21, and 22, have integrated elements of natural justice, giving rise to additional basic rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.
- Moreover, Article 32 has played a crucial role in guaranteeing the enjoyment of various fundamental rights, leading to the Supreme Court's establishment of new rights within the ambit of fundamental rights.
- Considering the inevitable overlap between Articles 226 and 32, it is essential to read Article 226 alongside Article 32, and examine the relevant case laws pertaining to fundamental rights, particularly Articles 20, 21, and 22.

</div></div>
 
## Fundamental Rights under Part III
- Part III list fundamental rights and also mentions the limits in these rights. 
- The government has a **constitutional duty** to protect the fundamental and human rights of its citizens, irrespective of who they are. 
- Almost all of the Fundamental rights are available against the State except these four articles i.e. (These rights are available against a private individual, rest all are available against the State)
	- Article 15 (2) (Non-discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth),
	- Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability),
	- Article 19
	- Article 21
	- Article 23 (prohibits traffic in human beings, women, children, [[Beggars\|beggars]] or other forced labour) and
	- Article 24 (prohibits employing children below the age of 14 years in any hazardous profession) 
### Right to Equality
>Equality means the absence of special privilege to any section of the society and the provision of adequate opportunities for all individuals without any discrimination. #definition 
- Civic equality is granted as equal rights and freedoms to all the people and social groups. There should not be any discrimination of superior and inferior, the rich and the poor, caste and creed, colour and race, clan and tribes, groups and classes. #definition 
- The following provision ensures civic equality 
	- Equality before Law - Article 14. “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.”. It guarantees only the idea of similarity of treatment but not identical treatment. The identical treatment is contradictory to the idea of Equal protection of the law which allows positive discrimination in the favour of less privileged groups.
	- Prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth - Article 15
	- Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment - Article 16
	- Abolition of untouchability - Article 17
	- Abolition of titles - Article 18
- Political equality is defined as equal opportunities for participation of all in the political process. #definition

# Reservation provisions
- Article 16(4) of the Constitution explicitly clarifies that a policy like reservation will not be seen as a violation of right to equality.

	- In **Balaji v/s State of Mysore #case**, it was held that ‘caste of a person cannot be the sole criteria for ascertaining whether a particular caste is backward or not. Determinants such as poverty, occupation, place of habitation may all be relevant factors to be taken into consideration.
- Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 - to provide 75% reservation for local people in private sector jobs that pay below ₹30,000 a month. Industry bodies raised concerns.

# Internet as a fundamental right
- Internet shutdown in J&K on 4th August 2019 and took 213 days to restore it.
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Internet shutdowns: The past four years have seen more than 400 shutdowns. It will freeze economic activities and cause large scale disruptions in economic output. India is estimated to have lost over 20,000 crore in 2020 due to internet shutdowns. 

</div></div>

- 1 out of 10 people have internet access in developing countries. 
- 70% of all the internet shutdowns in the world in 2020 were from India - as per Access Now report.
- As per a report by Freedom House on Freedom on the Net 2020, India has ranked at 51st position. The report also labeled India’s internet as 'partly free'. 
- Cases associated

</div></div>

- According to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.” It guarantees that life or personal liberty shall not be taken away without the sanction of law. 
	- This Article guarantees freedom of life to every Indian citizen against arbitrary action of the state. 
	- According to the interpretation made in Maneka Gandhi #case, the procedure established by law includes the meaning of the due process of law. 
	- When a law is passed according to the procedure established by law, the due process of law checks the fairness and justness of the law. 
	- Hence when a law is passed with a reasonable restriction that abridges the personal liberty of a person, such person cannot avail of the remedy.
- Article 21 guarantees the Right to Fair Trial and Investigation. 
	- An accused is entitled to a fair investigation.
	-  Fair investigation and fair trial are concomitant to preservation of fundamental right of an accused under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 
	- Thus if the lower court refuses to give a copy of the charge sheet and statements of witnesses to the accused, it violates Article 21 of the Indian constitution.
	- India's status in Freedom in the World report by the Freedom House changed from 'free' to 'partly free' in 2021. It has cited the alleged use of Pegasus on Indian citizens as on of the reasons for downgrade.
### Right against Exploitation
### Right to Freedom of religion
- Article 25 - Personal religious rights
- Article 25(1) of the Constitution guarantees the “freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion”.
- It is a right that guarantees a negative liberty - which means that the state shall ensure that there is no interference or obstacle to exercise this freedom.
- However, like all fundamental rights, the state can restrict the right for grounds of **public order, morality, health and other provisions of this part**.
- Article 25 excludes secular activities from its purview. 
	- Secular activities are to be dealt with by the State and not the religion. 
	- It is a key point to notice that matters like divorce, adoption, inheritance are matters of law and not of religion.
- **Doctrine of Essentiality**
{ #6de41c}

	- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Shirur Mutt #case, 1954 - Doctrine of Essential Practices was invented by SC. The court held that the term “religion” will cover all rituals and practices “integral” to a religion, and took upon itself the responsibility of determining the essential and non-essential practices of a religion. 

</div></div>

	- *Resham vs State of Karnataka #case*: Banned wearing of headscarves (hijab) by students in educational institutions.
		- Classrooms are "qualified public spaces", where individual rights cannot be asserted to "the detriment" of general discipline and decorum.
	- In Amna Bint Basheer vs Central Board of Secondary Education #case, (2016) Kerala HC held that practice of wearing hijab is an essential religious practice in Islam.
	- In Fathima Tasneem vs State of Kerala #case (2018), Kerala HC held that collective rights of an institution would be given primacy over the individual rights of the petitioner.
	- In 2004 SC concluded that performance of Tandava dance was not indispensable to the Ananda Margis faith, even though the followers of that religion believed it to be so.
	- In Bijoe Emmanuel #case, 1986 the rights of Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to partake in the singing of national anthem was protected.
- Article 26 - Community based rights
	- Against the background of inter-communal strife, the Constitution upholds its commitment to group rights (the right to the expression of cultural particularity). 
	- Unlike Germany or France we have several linguistic and religious communities. 
	- It was important to ensure that no one community systematically dominates others. 
	- This made it mandatory for our Constitution to recognise community based rights.

### Right to property - constitutional right/legal right

# Right to property
- **Article 300-A** states that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. This means
	- Right to property is not a fundamental right, cannot move to SC for its violation under [[Article 32\|Article 32]]
	- A law will be necessary to deprive a person of his property.
	- Right to property has been relegated to the status of a constitutional right by [[Forty fourth Amendment Act, 1978\|Forty fourth Amendment Act, 1978]].
-  Article 300A includes tangible, and intangible IPR, corporeal and incorporeal properties.
- Right to Property was a fundamental right under [[Article 19\|Article 19]] and 31.
- In several cases, the Supreme Court of India has held that the right to property is not just a statutory right but is also a human right.
	- Recently the Supreme Court in Vidhya Devi vs The State of Himachal Pradesh & Others, held that the Right to own Private Property is a human right and cannot be denied. So, the right to property under Article 300A is a human right.
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 under Section 17(i) and (ii) also recognizes right to property.

## The Demand for Gender Equality in Property Law
- In August 2020, the Supreme Court in Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma #case, held that Hindu women could claim equal rights as men in ancestral property.
- Previously, only male members of a family could claim a right in ancestral property.
- Hindu Succession Act 1956 had been amended to this effect in 2005.
- In 1937, **Dr. G. Deshmukh** authored the **Hindu Women’s Right to Property Act**, which gave widows the right to inherit their deceased husband’s property.
- Ambedkar wanted equal property rights for women as a foundation for other social reforms.

</div></div>

### Right to Constitutional remedies
- Constitution under Article 32 and 226 empowers the Supreme Court and High Courts to issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. 
- When the Fundamental Rights of a citizen are violated, the aggrieved party has the option of moving either the high court or the Supreme Court directly. 
- Further, the ==Parliament (under Article 32) can empower any other court to issue these writs.==
	- A writ is a command of the court given in writing under its seal.
	- Since no such provision has been made so far, only the Supreme Court and the high courts can issue the writs and not any other court.
- It is so because this right gives a citizen the right to approach a High Court or the Supreme Court to get any of the fundamental rights restored in case of their violation. 
- The Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue their orders and give directives to the government for the enforcement of rights.
- Right to Constitutional Remedies provided under the [[Article 32\|Article 32]] of the Constitution was considered as ‘**heart and soul of the constitution**’ by Dr. Ambedkar.
## Fundamental rights and Emergency
- ==Article 358 of Constitution provides for automatic suspension of freedom of speech and expression under [[Article 19\|Article 19]].==
- Article 359 of Constitution provides for suspension of enforcement of fundamental rights
	- **Right to constitutional remedies are not immune from suspension under any kind of** [[National Emergency\|National Emergency]]
	-  Presidential order mentions which all right’s enforcement are suspended.
