# MODERN INDIAN HISTORY
[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Arrival of Europeans\|Arrival of Europeans]] by the end of 15th century marks a major turning point in the history of our country. They took a keen interest in the resources that India had to offer and have been looked back at as plunderers of India’s wealth of resources - as they took cotton, spices, silk, and tea, amongst numerous other resources.

Capitalising on the [[Decline of the Mughals and Rise of regional kingdoms\|Decline of the Mughals and Rise of regional kingdoms]], [[East India Company\|East India Company]] and the other European trading companies made huge profits and political and economic gains in India. [[Consolidation of British power in India\|Consolidation of British power in India]] was a gradual process. By the last quarter of the 18th Century, the English had outdone all others and established themselves as the dominant power in India.

The British administered India for a period of about two centuries and brought about revolutionary changes in the [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Social and Cultural policy of British\|social]], [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Imperial policies and Political Change in British India FOC\|political]] and [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/BRITISH ECONOMIC POLICIES IN INDIA\|economic]] life of the country. It is important to look up on the [[Structural changes during Colonialism\|Structural changes during Colonialism]] to understand the impact of such interventions.

[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/EDUCATIONAL POLICIES DURING BRITISH RAJ\|EDUCATIONAL POLICIES DURING BRITISH RAJ]] introduced western education in India. Rise of middle class intelligentsia was a result of this western education. [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/SOCIO-RELIGIOUS REFORM MOVEMENTS\|SOCIO-RELIGIOUS REFORM MOVEMENTS]] were mainly led by these western educated middle class intelligentsia.

The British Raj was divisive and pit Indians against one another ([[Policy of Divide and Rule\|Policy of Divide and Rule]]), on the basis of religion; and also mistreated the laborers. The Indians were essentially slaves of the British rule and were working hard without any returns on their work. This, naturally, led to multiple resistance movements; and [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Prominent freedom fighters FOC\|Prominent freedom fighters]] came to the forefront.

[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/THE GREAT REVOLT OF 1857\|THE GREAT REVOLT OF 1857]] is often considered as the culmination of all the [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Popular Resistance to Foreign Rule\|Popular Resistance to Foreign Rule]] before 1857. British initiated drastic [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/POLICY CHANGES AFTER 1857\|POLICY CHANGES AFTER 1857]].  [[Government of  India Act of 1858\|Government of  India Act of 1858]] transferred the power from EIC to British crown, the [[Imperialism\|British Indian Empire]] is established.  
  
The first war of Independence sowed the seeds of Nationalism. Along with the spirit of 1857 revolt, multiple other factors like role of press, rediscovery India's past glory etc. contributed to the [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Emergence of Nationalism\|Emergence of Nationalism]] in Indian soil. Formation of [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC)\|INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC)]] in 1885 was the culmination of a process of political awakening that had its beginning in the 1860s.  

To weaken the nationalism British had gone to the extent of [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Partition of Bengal and Swadeshi Movement\|Partition of Bengal and Swadeshi Movement]] was launched by the [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC)\|Indian National Congress]] to oppose the decision to partition Bengal. Formation of [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Muslim League\|Muslim League]] in the first decade of the 20th century was a major blow to national unity. 

[[HOMERULE LEAGUE MOVEMENT\|HOMERULE LEAGUE MOVEMENT]] demanded Self-Government for Indians within the British dominion. It took inspiration from Home Rule Movement of Ireland.

[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Gandhi's arrival in India\|Gandhi's arrival in India]] and rise of Gandhian nationalism opened a new chapter in Indian National Movement. It became a mass movement and started spreading into rural areas. Women and students started actively participating in freedom struggle.

This saw Hindu-Muslim unity. The sudden withdrawal of [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/NON COOPERATION MOVEMENT\|NCM]] resulted in the rise of second phase of [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Revolutionary movements during freedom struggle\|Revolutionary movements during freedom struggle]].

To appease Indians, British came up with many constitutional reforms. 

[[Montagu Chelmsford Act\|Government of India Act 1919]] introduced Bicameral legislature and dyarchy at the centre. It further extended the communal representation, which was first introduced in [[Indian Councils Act of 1909\|Morley-Minto Reforms]] to Sikhs, Europeans and Anglo Indians.

[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Simon Commission\|Simon Commission]] was appointed to review the functioning of the government under the [[Montagu Chelmsford Act\|Montford schemes]]  and to suggest reforms.

[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/NEHRU COMMITTE REPORT\|NEHRU COMMITTE REPORT]] was the first Indian effort to draft a constitutional scheme (as a reaction to **Lord Birkenhed challenge**). In order to counter the proposals made in the Nehru Report, Jinnah presented his proposal in the form of [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/JINNAH'S 14 POINT PROGRAMME\|Fourteen Points]], insisting that no scheme for the future constitution of the government of India will be satisfactory to the Muslims until and unless stipulations were made to safeguard their interests.

[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Purna Swaraj\|Purna Swaraj]] resolution was passed on 19 December 1929, at its Lahore session. A public declaration was made on 26 January 1930 called for “complete freedom from the British”. It was reportedly drafted by [[Mahatma Gandhiji\|Mahatma Gandhi]].

High salt tax, popular dissatisfaction with constitutional reforms, emergence of radical youth in Congress etc. led to the announcement of [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT\|CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT]]. During the course of CDM, [[Round Table Conferences\|Round Table Conferences]] constituted to discuss the report submitted by the [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Simon Commission\|Simon Commission]].

British expression of [[Policy of Divide and Rule\|Policy of Divide and Rule]] was now extended to all communities.

The British felt the necessity of instituting constitutional reforms in India. The government formulated the constitutional reforms in the form of [[Government of India Act of 1935\|Government of India Act of 1935]] based on the recommendations of the [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Simon Commission\|Simon Commission]], Third Round Table Conference, “White paper” of the government and the report of Joint Select Committees of the Parliament.

[[Government of India Act of 1935\|Government of India Act of 1935]] provided for direct [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/ELECTION OF 1937 AND CONSEQUENCES\|provincial elections]]. [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC)\|Congress]] has formed the popular government in 11 out of 17 provinces.

In September 1939, [[World War II\|World War II]] started and Britain made India a party to the war without consulting the political entities in the country. [[National movement during World War II\|National movement during World War II]] saw difference of opinions among major leaders and splits.

Gandhiji started [[Individual satyagraha\|Individual satyagraha]] to show that nationalist patience was not due to weakness. [[Cripps mission\|Cripps mission]] was sent to India with constitutional proposals to seek Indian support for the war. 

[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/QUIT INDIA MOVEMENT\|QUIT INDIA MOVEMENT]] was the most defining moment of our freedom struggle. [[Mahatma Gandhiji\|Mahatma Gandhiji]] coined the slogan 'do or die' during the movement. 

[[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Indian National Army (INA)\|Indian National Army (INA)]] agitation was one of the land mark event towards the end of the British rule in India. The event internationalised the issue of Indian independence.

Factors like the tired and weak position of Britain after [[World War II\|World War II]], the victory of **Labour party** in post war elections, the strong demand of [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Muslim League\|League]] for a separate Muslim nation etc. made [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/TRANSFER OF POWER AND PARTITION\|TRANSFER OF POWER AND PARTITION]] inevitable.

It is imperative to study the [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/CONTRIBUTIONS AND DIFFERENT VOICES\|CONTRIBUTIONS AND DIFFERENT VOICES]] heard in the freedom movement. There are many [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/Prominent freedom fighters FOC\|Prominent freedom fighters]] associated with Indian freedom movement.
