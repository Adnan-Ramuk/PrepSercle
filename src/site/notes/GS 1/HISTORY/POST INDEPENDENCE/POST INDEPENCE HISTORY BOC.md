# POST INDEPENCE HISTORY


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




[[19-03-2021-Friday\|19-03-2021-Friday]]  9:38 PM #review 

# Post Independence consolidation
- At the time of independence India faced a daunting task of integration of the country. There were almost 565 native states, small and big in the country.
- The government’s approach towards princely states was guided by the following considerations.
	- The people of most of the princely states clearly wanted to become part of the Indian Union. Government was prepared to be flexible in giving autonomy to some of these regions.
	- In the back drop of partition, the integration and consolidation of the territorial boundaries of the nation had assumed supreme importance.
 ## Pre-partition map of India 
![india-map-prepartition.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/india-map-prepartition.jpg)
## Challenges faced during integration
- Numerous fragmented princely states: there were more than 600 princely states in independent India. They covered a large swathes of area without which India would be complete. (1/3 of land area and 1 out of 4 Indian lived in princely states)
- Support of the British fuelling aspirations: Atlee's statement in Feb 1947, that British paramountcy over the native states would never be transferred. ([[Policy of paramountcy\|Paramountcy or suzerainty of British crown]])
- Centrifugal tendencies:  these princely states had supported the British government during the freedom movement and despised the Congress leadership. Many of the states were steadfast in keeping their freedom and determined to thwart Indian efforts to integrate them.
- **Indian Independence Act** also strengthened their position.
- They had Three choices
	- Join India
	- Join Pakistan
	- Remain independent
- Diverse nature of Princely States.
- Fear of Balkanization: an Eastern Europe like situation post - Ottoman era was much feared in India if all the princely states were to remain independent.
- Jinnah promoted separatist tendencies: Jinnah was collaborating efforts to woo some princely states onto his side including Kashmir, Bhopal, Junagarh and Hyderabad. Jinnah in a statement publicly declared that the native states were free to remain independent if they so desired.
 - Some states proposed confederation of Princely states. Hyderabad tried to lease out or purchase Goa from Portuguese. Travancore also wanted to become independent (thorium deposits and strategic importance)

## Initial resistance later weakened 
- Due to:
	- LACK OF UNITY
	- DISTRUST - e.g. Hindu population did not trust Nawab of Bhopal. (considered him as an agent of Pakistan)
	- Role of [[Governor Generals and Viceroy's in India#Lord Mountbatten March 1947-June 1948\|Mountbatten]]
	- Pressure and Diplomacy (two key figures SARDAR PATEL and VP MENON)
	- Instrument of Accession, Standstill agreement.

## Four step process of integration
1. MERGER AGREEMENTS, Covenants of Merger - (e.g.  Travancore-Kochin in 1949)
2. CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY - classified units into three categories - Part A, B and C states.
3. Reorganisation - Through States Reorganisation Act 1956, 7th amendment removed classification of states, part C - Union Territories. Rajapramukhs lost their authority. ==Privy purse was abolished in 1971.==
4. Colonial Enclaves  - ceded or merged, Goa and Daman and Diu (1961) - Military action after failed negotiations - pressure from within and from Africa. - Goa became a state in 1987 - Sikkim was integrated in 1975 as 22nd state. **Anti Chogyal agitation** broke out in 1973.
## Sardar Patel and the Process of integration
- Great skill and masterful diplomacy of Sardar Patel succeed in the programme. He was assisted, by the able VP Menon the Secretary of the newly created State's Department.
- They adopted a twin strategy of persuasion and pressure: Two types of agreements were concluded: **Standstill and Instrument of Accession**
- Integration through Negotiation - The appeals to the princely states were in line of simple terms like cultural homogeneity, administrative viability, patriotism etc. He first appealed to the princes inside the union to accede on 3 subjects with common interests IR, defence and communication. He offered honourable terms to the native rulers. Eventually most of them signed the instrument of accession.
- Forced intervention-Massive agitations was organized in the intransigent states who refused to sign. Ajmer and Travancore, Bhopal eventually succumbed. This pressure applied in large scale where massive popular movement led to the Nawab being deposed and he fled. Subsequently plebiscite was conducted.
	- Junagarh - SUPPLY CUT (fuel and coal), then Plebiscite.
- By August 14, 1947 except 3, all other had acceded (including Manipur. (Manipur was the first state to conduct elections on universal adult franchise - signed merger agreement in 1949)
## Military and policy intervention
- Annexation of Hyderabad (largest) - 18 September 1948 - NIZAM OSMAN ALI KHAN  - RAZAKARS (Nizam's paramilitary) -  **OPERATION POLO**.
- Kashmir war - October 1947 (Pathan tribes intruded)
- Goa liberation - December 1961, KP Candeth
- Dadra and Nagar Haveli -1954

## Problems with Travancore
## Problems with Hyderabad
## Problems with Kashmir
## French enclaves
- Integration of French territories was done peacefully. After the formation of Union of India, the rising nationalism in the people and shift of French India socialist party to pro-merger, forced French government to sign a referendum with India.
- In 1954, the four enclaves Karaikal, Mahi, Yanam and Puducherry were transferred to the Indian Union and became the Union territory of Pondicherry.
## Portuguese enclaves
- Dadra and Nagar Haveli: Portugal resisted diplomatic solutions and refused to transfer power to Union of India. Volunteers of United Front of Goans occupied Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1954 and displaced Portuguese rule.
- Goa, Daman and Diu: Satyagraha and revolts by Indian nationalists were suppressed by Portuguese government. Indian government tried to raise the issue before the international community. But Portugal resisted all overtures from India. In 1961, in **Operation Vijay** the Indian Army liberated Goa, Daman and Diu by force.

## Why didn’t NATO react when India captured Goa
- Nehru timed the aggression within months of JFK taking over. The new administration in USA was focused on **Bay of Pigs** operation in Cuba.
- And adding to that JFK sympathised with India unlike his predecessor. US didn’t want NATO to be seen as siding imperial powers and lose political capital and credibility at a very critical time in Cuba and Vietnam.
- Most of the world from newly liberated colonies in Africa, West Asia, East Asia to USSR and Soviet bloc countries to even China supported India. Even common wealth members stayed neutral.
- USA was waging a war in Vietnam. So going against India was considered a great disaster to USA. For most, Goa was too unimportant compared to the action in other places.
- Portugal and US tried to use the UN for an action. Thanks to USSR Veto, UN Security Council refused to vote against India. Salazar (dictator of Portugal) was not a likable figure and as an autocratic dictator he didn’t have many friends in the liberal minded members of NATO.




</div></div>


## Privy purse
- The Privy purse was a payment made to the royal families of erstwhile princely states as part of their agreements to integrate with India whereby they lost all ruling rights. They are allowed to retain certain private property, and given a grant in heredity or government allowance, measured on the basis of the extent, revenue and potential of the merging state.
- At the time of accession, there was little criticism of these privileges since integration and consolidation was the primary aim. Yet, hereditary privileges were not consonant with the principles of equality and socio-economic justice laid down in the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/CONSTITUTION BOC\|Constitution]] of India.
- Nehru had expressed dissatisfaction over the matter time and again. Following the 1967 elections, Indira Gandhi supported the demand that the government should abolish privy purses. 
- Morarji Desai called the move morally wrong and amounting to a breach of faith with the princes.
- In the 1971, the Constitution was amended to remove legal obstacles for abolition of privy purses.
## How was it blood less
1. Patel’s first step was to appeal to the princes to accede to the Indian Union in three subjects which affected the common interests of the country, namely, foreign relations, defence and communications.
2. Next step of Patel was to convince Mountbatten to bat for India. Mountbatten, in a speech to chamber of princes, finally persuaded the Princes.
3. Privy purses, upholding succession to throne, flying of personal flags were used as tools of persuasion.
4. States not ready to accede to India where made to sign instrument of accession through diplomacy. e.g. Travancore, Jodhpur, Bhopal, Junagadh, etc. Ruler of Kashmir was made to sign instrument of accession before offering any military assistance.
5. Prolonged negotiations with French led to Pondicherry becoming part of India.
## Not completely blood less
1. People organised a popular movement in Junagadh, forced the Nawab to flee and established a provisional government. Indian troops thereafter marched into the state. A plebiscite was held in the state which went overwhelmingly in favour of joining India.
2. In case of Hyderabad, Nizam of Hyderabad denied accession to India. A strong peasant struggle and satyagraha by state congress had developed in the Telangana region. In 1948, the Indian army moved into Hyderabad and freed it from Nizam control. The operation was called **operation Polo**.
3. After the formation of Union of India the major foreign enclaves were French and Portuguese. On gaining independence India opened negotiations with them for the transfer of territories.
4. Indian troops marched in Goa under **operation Vijay** and Portuguese surrendered without fight.

## FACTORS HELPED IN INTEGRATION OF INDIANS AS A POLITICAL COMMUNITY
- [[GS 1/SOCIETY/DIVERSITY OF INDIA#Unity in Diversity\|UNITY IN DIVERSITY]]
- [[Parliamentary System\|Parliament]] ACTED AS A GREAT UNIFIER of the Nation  - Asoka Mehta
- Prominent Leaders were not associated with any one region, religion, language or caste (Nehru, PATEL, MAULANA, RAJENDRA PRASAD, JP, RAM MANOHAR LOHIA)
- INDIAN ARMY AND ADMINSTRATIVE SERVICE - ALL INDIA CHARACTER
- INDUSTRIALISATION, NATIONAL MARKET, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT - ACCOMODATIVE POLICIES TOWARDS STATES.
- CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS LIKE RESERVATION, UNTOUCHABILTY AS AN OFFENCE, [[Secularism\|Secularism]].
- POLICIES LIKE - ABOLITION OF LANDLORDISM.
- FOREIGN POLICY SERVED AS ANOTHER UNIFYING FORCE - [[Non Alignment Movement\|NAM]], ANTI-COLONIALISM

# Nehruvian Era
## Challenges faced by the nation
The colonial legacy left by the British had totally devastated the nation socially, economically, politically and culturally. Main challenges were : 
1.  To protect unity of the nation
2.  To establish democracy
3.  To ensure development and well being to all.
- Woes of partition-the country had underwent a terrible partition with the formation of independent India and Pakistan (two nation theory-birth of Pakistan) and it was followed by: 
	- **Communal holocaust** - the partition was one of the bloodiest events in the world which witnessed large scale migration and loss of life. Almost 5,00,000 people lost their lives in post-partition riots . A communal mentality was raised among the masses in the country as people of different faiths saw each other with suspicion. Great damage and loss of property took place during these riots.
		- In many cases women were killed by their own family to preserve family honour
	- **Rehabilitation of refugees** - around 6 million refugees were generated due to the incident. Many of them had given up all their belongings and had migrated fearing persecution. These refugees who were communally charged and also targetted the minority community in India. Also these refugees had to resettled. This was especially true in the Punjab border.
		- Estimated 80 lakh migrated across border.
	- **Massive law and order issue** - communal flareups became common which created a law and order issue.
- [[GS 1/HISTORY/POST INDEPENDENCE/Integration of Princely States\|Integration of States]] - almost 40% of the country's landmass were under the princely states who were hostile to the concept of freedom.
- **Formulation and making of a constitution** - a constituent assembly was constituted which as per the provisions of the GoI act,1947 acted as the chief body for the making of the constitution and also as the temporary decision maker and thus the government. 
	- A constitution had to cater the needs of India's large and diverse populace, allay the fears of minority, establish and strengthen the institutions of democracy.
- **Economic Backwardness** - colonialism became a fetter for India's agricultural and industrial development.
	- Agrarian structure and land revenue policies-led to proliferation of Zamindars who cornered most of the land while a large part of the country's farmers where landless labourers. 
	- Subinfeudation, tenancy, lack of adoption of modern techniques inhibited the growth of agriculture. Commercialization had been beneficial only to the wealthy farmers while smaller ones struggled to cope up to the high input costs.
	- **State of its industry: Negatives**
		- Collapse of indigenous industry was a feature of the colonists who tried promoting British industries and commercial interests. It led to deindustrialization of the country.
		- Industrial Growth stunted
		- Supplier of raw material rather than manufactured goods
		- Poor development of high technology, capital intensive industries
		- Absence of investments in development of industries-most of the excessive surplus earned from India was siphoned of to Britain through 'Drain of Wealth'. Defence budget bloated durign the second world war to support Britain's war efforts.
		- Lopsided industrial development
			- >The New Economic Policy – 1921 of Lenin had influenced the policies adopted by India soon after independence. Evaluate.     #PYMQ, 2014
	- **State of industries: positives**
		- Small number of capital intensive industries were started
		- Development of Indian owned industrial base.
		- Rise of strong industrial capital class
		- Good banking and insurance sector
- **Lack of Science and Technology development.**
- **Socio-cultural issues**
	- [[Caste system in India\|Casteism]] and [[GS 1/SOCIETY/Communalism\|communalism]] in society-prevented upward mobilization.
	- Patriarchy-presented a challenge to gender participation in economy
	- Poor education
	- Poor health infrastructure-only 10 medical colleges on the whole
- **Politico-administrative problems**
	- Existence of colonial structure-meant for exploitatory relationship, denial of state support of agri and industry, free trade etc.
	- Highly costly administration.
	- Weak and undeveloped democratic institutions.

## Developments in science and technology
The major achievement of the Nehruvian era was in the fields of scientific research and technological education. ==Nehru wanted usher in scientific temperament and rationality in the country==.
- **Policy formulation**
	- **Scientific Policy Resolution**-adopted in 1958, it acknowledges the role of science and technology in the economic, social and cultural advancement of the country.
- **Development of Research and Development** 
	- India's first national laboratory, the **National Physical Laboratory** was established in 1947 following which a network of seventeen national laboraties, specializing in different areas of research.
	- Nehru assumed Chairmanship of the **Council of Scientific and Industrial Research** which guided and financed the national laboratories.
- **Incentivising Scientific education**
	- Established five IITs patterned over MIT with the first being setup at Kharagpur (1951). It allowed the training of technical personnel.
- **Development of strategic sectors**
	- **Nuclear**
		- India was one of the first nations to recognize the importance of nuclear energy.
		- The Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1948 with Homi J Bhabha as the apex body of the [[Awareness in the filed of Nuclear Science#India's three stage nuclear programme\|strategic nuclear programme]].
	- **Space**
		- INCOSPAR (Indian National Committee on Space Research) later became ISRO.

## Tribal Panchsheel
Tribal integration in post independence India marked a change towards tribals. During colonial times, the British followed a ‘**policy of isolation**,’ only selectively interfering to preserve British commercial interests. After 1947, the quest for unifying India nationally desired a ‘**policy of assimilation**’ for tribals. However, Pandit Nehru had a vision that wanted to secure tribal interests while mainstreaming them gradually to avoid cultural resistance or coercion.
### Tribal Panchsheel by Nehru
- **Autonomy** – Tribals should develop along the lines of their own genius, and the imposition of alien values should be avoided.
- **Tribal rights** in land and forests should be respected.
- **Participation** – Teams of tribals should be trained in the work of administration and development.
- **Reserved state intervention** – Tribal areas should not be over-administered or overwhelmed with a multiplicity of schemes.
- **Human Development** – Results should be judged not by statistics or the amount of money spent, but by the human character that is evolved.
### Relevance of Tribal Panchsheel in Northeast
- To tackle historical and geographical alienation that is simmering in the North East. A sound policy of integration could make them inherent stakeholders in India’s decision making.
- To safeguard tribal diversity, heritage and traditions. Over 200 of 635 tribal groups are in this region who speaks more than 220 languages. Schedule 6 and special status under **Article 371** reflects this.
- Prevent land alienation.
- Unlike tribes in mainstream India, tribes in northeast have lesser issues of poverty or health. Major issues are racialism against people from the North East, lack of communication and transportation infrastructure.
- Abiding by the principles espoused in the Panchsheel has fastened the process of integration of the tribes and there has been a progressive reduction in tribal insurgency.

### Assessment of Tribal Panchsheel on tribes in northeast
- **Successes**: 
	- 6th schedule (**Article 244**) status for Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram helped bring autonomy and self governance, protection to indigenous cultures and preservation of local value systems. **Virginius Xaxa**, chairman of high level #committee on tribal status has held that autonomous councils in north east helped prevent land alienation unlike in other tribal regions.
	- Special Status to Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Sikkim and Assam provides Governors with special responsibilities towards these states.
	- **Inner Line Permit** to Arunachal, Nagaland and Mizoram to preserve indigenity.
	- **Northeastern Council** as the nodal agency has a specific focus ==for the economic and social development of the [[Development of North East\|North Eastern Region]]==. Major employment initiatives have been taken by North east region Community Resource Management Project (NERCORMP). 
	- Separate Ministry - DoNER, Non-lapsable Central Pool of Resources scheme for speedy development of infrastructure.
	- Legislations – [[Forest Rights Act, 2006\|Forest Rights Act, 2006]] gives individual and community rights to forest lands.
	- **Nagaland Framework Agreement 2015** to reign in secessionary movements. Mizo autonomous movement was settled in 1986.
- **Limitations and challenges**:
	- Security reasons such as secession movements necessitate existence of AFSPA. It has resulted in issues of extra judicial killings, **Thangma Manorama #case** and so on.
	- Racialism and cultural alienation remains. e.g. lynching of north eastern students in Delhi. 	- Autonomous institutions limit uniformity in governance. e.g. resistance to participation of women in ULBs in Nagaland.

## Why didn’t NATO react when India captured Goa
- Nehru timed the aggression within months of JFK taking over. The new administration in USA was focused on **Bay of Pigs** operation in Cuba.
- And adding to that JFK sympathised with India unlike his predecessor. US didn’t want NATO to be seen as siding imperial powers and lose political capital and credibility at a very critical time in Cuba and Vietnam.
- Most of the world from newly liberated colonies in Africa, West Asia, East Asia to USSR and Soviet bloc countries to even China supported India. Even common wealth members stayed neutral.
- USA was waging a war in Vietnam. So going against India was considered a great disaster to USA. For most, Goa was too unimportant compared to the action in other places.
- Portugal and US tried to use the UN for an action. Thanks to USSR Veto, UN Security Council refused to vote against India. Salazar (dictator of Portugal) was not a likable figure and as an autocratic dictator he didn’t have many friends in the liberal minded members of NATO.

# Linguistic Reorganization and Formation of States
- Our national movement had promised the linguistic principle as the basis of formation of states. In fact after the **Nagpur session of Congress in 1920** the principle was recognised as the basis of the reorganisation of the [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC)\|INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC)]] party itself.
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- ==Article 2 gives Parliament the power to establish new states.== 

</div></div>

## Course of events-reorganisation
- Things changed after Independence and Partition. Our leaders felt that carving out states on the basis of language might lead to disruption and disintegration. 
- It was also felt that this would draw attention away from other social and economic challenges that the country faced. 
- But whatever options anybody else might have been considering were put to rest by the fast-unto-death of **Potti Sreeramulu** for a separate province of the Telugu people, free from Madras state. 
- Sheer mismanagement of the administration caused the death of Potti Sreeramulu, leading to widespread protests and finally the creation of Andhra Pradesh.
- State reorganisation #commission in 1953 and act in 1956.
- Language did not, however, remain the sole basis of organisation of states. 
	- In later years sub-regions raised demands for separate states on the basis of a separate regional culture or complaints of regional imbalance in development. (e.g. [[GS 1/HISTORY/POST INDEPENDENCE/POST INDEPENCE HISTORY BOC#Creation of new States in 2000\|formation of Chattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand]] and [[GS 1/HISTORY/POST INDEPENDENCE/POST INDEPENCE HISTORY BOC#Telangana movement\|Telangana]])
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- The war with China alerted Indian leadership to the volatile situation in the Northeast region. The process of its reorganisation began soon after the China war. Nagaland was granted statehood, Manipur and Tripura, though Union Territories, were given the right to elect their own legislative assemblies. 

</div></div>

- Organization has not come to an end. More regions are demanding statehood. (Vidarbha - in MH, Hari Pradesh in Western UP, [[GS 1/HISTORY/POST INDEPENDENCE/NORTH EAST PROBLEM#Gorkhaland\|Gorkhaland - in West Bengal]])

### The States Reorganisation Commission (SRC)
- It is constituted by the Parliament in 1953 to recommend the reorganization of state boundaries.
- In October 1955, the Commission, comprising Justice Fazal Ali, K. M. Panikkar and H. N. Kunzru presented its report.
- The commission accepted language as the basis of reorganisation of states. But, it rejected the theory of ‘one language-one state’.
- It identified four major factors that can be taken into account in any scheme of reorganisation of states: ( Fazal Ali #commission )
	- Preservation and strengthening of the unity and security of the country. 
	- Linguistic and cultural homogeneity.
	- Financial, economic and administrative considerations.
	- Planning and promotion of the welfare of the people in each state as well as of the nation.

### How Sikkim became a part of India
- Sikkim was a British Protectorate under the Treaty of Tumlong signed in March, 1861.         ( #trivia4prelims )
- It was on May 16, 1975 that Sikkim became 22nd state of the Union of India.
### Creation of new States in 2000
- In the creation of three new states in 2000, namely Chhattisgarh, Uttaranchal and Jharkhand, language did not play a prominent role. 
- Rather, a combination of ethnicity based on tribal identity, language, regional deprivation and ecology provided the basis for intense [[Regionalism\|regionalism]] resulting in statehood.
###  Telangana movement
- In the years after the formation of Andhra Pradesh state, people of Telangana expressed dissatisfaction over how the agreements and guarantees were implemented. 
- Discontent with the 1956 Gentleman’s agreement intensified in January 1969, when the guarantees that had been agreed on were supposed to lapse. 
- It led to creation of Telangana in 2014.

## Linguistic state creation served the following purposes
- Linguistic division strengthened national unity. - Language gives a mathematical basis for division. States will not fight over for the border territories.
- Led to nurturing and promotion of the regional language and culture, strengthening the country overall. 
- Above all, the linguistic states underlined the acceptance of the principle of diversity.
- Led to better interaction among people of the states and with their democratically elected governments. 
	- A linguistically heterogeneous state would have difficulty in getting messages across to its people.
- Led to better penetration of power to grass root level and local governments and better consolidation of democracy. A non English or non Hindi speaking person can aspire to become a political leader, which was difficult earlier.
- Led to consolidation of the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/STATE/FEDERAL STRUCTURE FOC\|federal structure]]. People realised that it was easy and peaceful to be Hindi-speaking and Indian, Tamil speaking and Indian, Gujarati-speaking and Indian, etc.
- Led to growth of English as a medium of inter-state and State-Centre communication, which would have been difficult had the states not been more or less linguistically homogenous.

But reorganisation did not resolve all the problems relating to linguistic conflicts. Disputes over boundaries between different states, linguistic minorities and economic issues such as sharing of waters, and power and surplus food still persist. **Linguistic chauvinism** also finds occasional expression. But the reorganisation has removed a major factor affecting cohesion of the country.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



## Lessons learned from regional conflicts
Even after six decades of independence, some of the issues of national integration are not fully resolved. We have seen that regional aspirations ranging from demands of statehood and economic development to autonomy and separation keep coming up.
- First and the most elementary lesson is that regional aspirations are very much a part of democratic politics. Even in countries like UK and Sri Lanka, the regional autonomy demands exist. A large and diverse democracy like India must deal with regional aspirations on a regular basis. ==Nation building is an ongoing process.==
- The second lesson is that the best way to respond to regional aspirations is through democratic negotiations rather than through force. The example of Mizoram shows how political settlement can resolve the problem of separatism effectively.
- The third lesson is about the significance of power sharing. It is not sufficient to have a formal democratic structure. Besides that, groups and parties from the region need to be given share in power at the state level. If regions are not given a share in the national level decision making, the feeling of injustice and alienation can spread.
- The fourth lesson is that ==regional imbalance in economic development contributes to the feeling of regional discrimination==. If some states remain poor and others develop rapidly, it leads to regional imbalances and inter-regional migrations.
- Finally, these cases make us appreciate the farsightedness of the makers of our Constitution in dealing with questions of diversity. The federal system adopted by India is a flexible arrangement. While most of the states have equal powers, there are special provisions for some states and the states in the North- East.

What distinguishes India from many other countries that face similar challenges is that, ==the constitutional framework in India is much more flexible and accommodative==. 

Therefore, regional aspirations are not encouraged to espouse separatism. ==Thus, politics in India has succeeded in accepting [[Regionalism\|regionalism]] as part and parcel of democratic politics.==

# Five Year Plans

</div>



[[09-02-2021-Tuesday\|09-02-2021-Tuesday]]  3:41 PM

# ISSUES RELATING TO PLANNING
>Planning: manner in which resources of a nation should be put to use - will have some general goals as well as specific objectives to be achieved within a specific period of time. ==Planning is necessary due to inter-regional disparity.== #definition 

## Types of planning
1. IMPERATIVE PLANNING - up to 7th FYP. Authority decides all aspects of planning - socialist countries.
3. INDICATIVE PLANNING - capitalist countries - Private sector is not rigidly controlled. State prepare a national vision document, and act as a facilitator and encourage private sector to contribute to plan targets - from 8th FYP (92-97) onwards. e.g. Japan shifting to microelectronics.
4. CENTRALIZED PLANNING - formulation and implementation at the hands of central authority, top to bottom approach - PLANNING COMMISSION.
5. DECENTRALIZED PLANNING - All decisions related to planning and implementation taken at grass root level - collective decisions - common citizens as stakeholders - [[NITI Aayog\|NITI Aayog]].
6. Regional planning - involves a small well defined area with specific objectives. e.g. Damodar Valley Corporation in India.
7. Rolling plan - new plans for every year - **Gunnar Myrdal** - **Janata government  in 1978-80**. Flexible and able to overcome the rigidity of fixed targets by mending targets as per changing conditions. Frequent revisions results in instability of the economy.

## FIVE YEAR PLANS (FYPs)
- Long term goals common to all FYPs
	- **growth**: Increase in value of goods and services produced by an economy.
	- **modernization**: improvement in technology, the more modernized the economy, the greater value created by it.
	- **self reliance**: relying on the resources of the country and avoid dependence on external inflows.
	- **[[GS 2/SOCIAL JUSTICE/SOCIAL JUSTICE TOC\|social justice]]**: [[GS 3/ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT/INCLUSIVE GROWTH/INCLUSIVE GROWTH BOC\|inclusive and equitable growth]] were inequalities are not steep.

1. 1951-56 - Harrold Domar model - priority was given to agriculture in view of import of food grains and address higher inflation. focus on Investment. Power and transport were other areas of emphasis.
2. 1956-61 - [[PC Mahalanobis\|PC Mahalanobis]] - industrialization with emphasis on development of basic goods (import substitution) & heavy industries (for machinery for industries). Gave the base for self reliance. Major heads of development are - Transport and Communication, Social Services, Industry and [[Mining\|Mining]] and Agriculture and community development.
3. 1961-66 - self reliance and self generating economy - development of both agriculture and industry - [[Wars fought by India\|two wars]] during this period, north faced floods and droughts - famine, foreign countries stopped food aid during war - later started [[Green Revolution\|green revolution]]. Resorted to [[International Monetary Fund (IMF)\|IMF]] borrowing for the first time. ==Rupee was devalued for the first time in 1966==.==Third plan failed==.

>1966-69 -plan holidays - lack of resources - 3 annual plans.

4. 1969 -74 - objective was growth with stability. concept of [[Buffer Stocking\|buffer stock]] - to achieve [[Food security\|Food security]] and self reliance. - special emphasis on improving the conditions of under privileged and weaker section.
5. 1974-78 - laid stress on employment, poverty alleviation (**Garibi Hatao**), and Higher economic growth for social justice. The plan also focused on self-reliance in agricultural production and defence. In 1978 the newly elected Morarji Desai government rejected the plan.

>Annual plan - 1978-80 (Rolling plan)

6. 1980-85 - removal of poverty, increase in employment, infrastructure development.
7. 1985-90 - accelerate food grain production and productivity.

# Shashtri years
Nehru's death led to political turmoil. It resulted in the rise of the syndicate-Kamaraj, Sanjeeva Reddy, Nijalingappa, SK Patil etc. Factionalism -Desai and Shastri were contenders. Finally Shastri elected.
## Challenges faced by Shashtri
- **Political**-the ministry ruled more independently and autonomously, kept a low political profile, challenges that he faced in this era were the **Official Language controversy**, flaring up of Punjabi subha demand and Goa's merger with Maharasthra.
- **Economy**-witnessed stagnation, slowdown in the rate of industrial growth, bloating military expenditure, slow down in agriculture production.
- **Social**-food scarcity, severe shortage etc. ==Started the State Food Trading Corporation of India.==
## Achievements of Shashtri
- **State Food Trading Corporation**
- Initiation of [[Green Revolution\|Green Revolution]]
- Creation of PMO
- Successful defence of the country in war and the **Tashkent Declaration**.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



## 1965 war with Pakistan
- At the time Pakistan was led by **Gen Mohd Ayub Khan**, a military dictator. He was looking to divert attention from internal troubles.
- **Operation Gibraltar** launched - was the code name given to the strategy of Pakistan to infiltrate Jammu and Kashmir, and start a rebellion against Indian rule discretely. If successful, Pakistan hoped to gain control over Kashmir, but the operation resulted in a major failure.
- War broke out immediately.
- Rann of Kutchh infiltrate.
- Three weeks of fighting in 1965 has done immense damage to economies of both countries. 
- Apart from loss of life and costly military equipment, resources urgently needed for economic development were drained and defence budgets mounted again.
### Tashkent Treaty
- ==The Tashkent Declaration was a peace agreement between India and Pakistan==. Signed on 10 January 1966 that resolved the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.
- Peace had been achieved on 23 September by the intervention of the great powers who pushed the two nations to cease fire, afraid the conflict could escalate and draw in other power. 
- The Soviets, represented by Premier Alexei Kosygin, moderated between Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Muhammad Ayub Khan. 

#### Details
- The Tashkent conference, under UN, American and Soviet pressure, compelled India to give away the conquered region in Pakistan and maintain the 1949 ceasefire line in Kashmir.
- Both sides agreed to withdraw from all occupied areas and return to their pre-war August positions.
- In the case of India this meant, removing troops from strategic Haji Pir pass, from which Pakistani rangers could enter the Kashmir valley easily.
- This also meant India giving up other strategic gains in Kashmir.
- [[Shashtri years\|Shastri]] agreed to these unfavourable terms as other option was the resumption of mutually disastrous war and that would also have meant losing USSR support on Kashmir issue in UNSC and in supply of defence equipment, especially MiG planes and medium and heavy tanks.
- **Provisions:**
	- Both nations would agree to status quo and pull back their forces to the pre-war boundaries.
	- Not to interfere in the internal matters of each other.
	- Transfer of prisoners of war to each other.
	- Work upon building of good relations.
- **Limitations**:
	- The agreement was criticized in India because it did not contain a no-war pact or any renunciation of guerrilla warfare in Kashmir.
	- PoK still remains a contentious issue

### Lessons learnt from 1965 war
- The Pakistan infiltrators failed to generate support from Kashmiris. India’s had passed its first major test of [[Secularism\|Secularism]] as there was no communal trouble during the war. Indian muslims gave whole hearted support to the war. - In 1965 Indian commanders were new in handling brigade and division sized forces in battles. The war experience helped in consolidating organisation and leadership.
- Since 1965, there were marked changes in the way government coordinated with the 3 service chiefs.
	- Strengths and weaknesses of the three divisions of military were understood and worked upon, which proved crucial during [[GS 1/HISTORY/POST INDEPENDENCE/POST INDEPENCE HISTORY BOC#Bangladesh war of liberation -1971\|the 1971 war]]. 
	- The imperative of joint warfare in which the Army, the Navy and the Air Force operated to a cohesive plan towards common objectives became a key ingredient of war plans.
	- The role of technology in the outcome of wars was carefully observed and built into military doctrines.
- It also made the Indian political leadership more mature in dealing with major powers to safeguard India’s interests diplomatically.

# Land Reforms
Land reforms involve redistribution of land i.e.  taking away land from rich and distributing it to poor. 
- It also involves 
	- abolishing intermediaries such as Zamindar, Jagirdar etc., 
	- land ceilings,
	- tenancy reforms, 
	- computerisation of land records, 
	- forest rights act, 
	- land consolidation, etc.
## Land relations in India
- **before British**
	- ==Private ownership of land did not exist.== Land belonged to the village community. Land was never treated as the property of the Kings. Land matters and civil disputes were adjudicated by Panchayats within the village.
	- Farmers usually grew various food crops wheat, maize, paddy, jowar, bajra and pulses.
- **During British rule**
	- Introduced private ownership of land. This divided village into Landlords, Tenants and Labourers. Because of this material transformation the agrarian society in India witnessed profound social, economic, political, cultural and psychological change.
	- With generations, land kept dividing among sons. So, land got fragmented resulting in diseconomies of scale, lower production.
	- Farmer had to approach British courts for matters related to revenue, property attachment, debt-mortgage etc. So, Panchayats lost their power and prestige.
	- Since British demand revenue in cash, farmers resorted to growing cash crops such as indigo, sugarcane, cotton, etc. So, area under food crop cultivation declined.
## Post independence land reforms
### objectives of land reforms
1. To enhance the productivity of land by improving the economic conditions of farmers and tenants so that they may have the interest to invest in and improve agriculture.
2. To ensure **distributive justice** and to create an egalitarian society by eliminating all forms of exploitation.
3. To create a system of peasant proprietorship with the motto of **land to the tiller**. To transfer the incomes of the few to many so that the demand for consumer goods would be created.
4. Abolition of intermediaries, tenancy reforms to regulate fair rent and provide security to tenure and ceilings on holdings and distribution of surplus land among the landlords. Consolidation of holdings and prevention of their further fragmentation and development of cooperative farming were also objectives.

Land reforms carried out on the recommendations of the **Congress Agrarian Reforms Committee headed by JC Kumarappa**. Process of land reforms occurred on two broad phases. 
- First Phase (till the early 1960s) - Actions focused on : 
	- Abolition of Zamindari system : The major objective of land reforms in free India was to abolish intermediaries and to bring changes in the revenue system that would be favourable to cultivators. The process of abolition of Zamindari, Jagirdari, Ryotwari etc. system had started even before the constitution of India came into effect. 
		- Right to property was enshrined as fundamental right under article 19 and 31. The provinces passed the Zamindari Abolition Acts but all these acts were challenged in the court on account of their constitutional validity. The supreme court upheld the rights of Zamindars. To secure the constitutional validity of these state acts, the parliament passed [[1st Amendment\|first amendment]] (1951) within 15 months of enactment of the constitution and second amendment in 1959. 	- Tenancy reforms: After passing the Zamindari Abolition Acts, the next major problem was of tenancy regulation. Tenancy reforms aim to regulation of rent, provide security of tenure and conferring ownership to tenants - *"land to the tillers"*. The tenancy reforms laws provide the provisions for registration of tenants, or giving ownership rights to the former tenants to bring them directly under the state.  
		- In the case of ownership transfer, states like UP, MP, Andhra Pradesh etc. transferred the land straightaway to the tenants and asked them to pay a certain compensation to the landowners.
		- In other states like Punjab and Bihar, it was voluntary for the tenants to purchase the land.
		- The land consolidation was not a huge success as only 35 % of land could be consolidated. It was also not compulsory despite the suggestions from the National Commission of Agriculture.
	- Ceiling on landholdings : The land ceiling acts define the size of land that an individual/family can own. In India, by 1961-62, all the state governments have passed the land ceiling acts. But the ceiling limits varied from state to state.
	- Cooperativisation.

### Success
- Abolition of Zamindari and begar system.
- Almost 3% of agricultural land in India were distributed to tenants.
- Protection of tenants and fair rents.
- Modern capitalist based farming was introduced as most large farmers took to private cultivation.
- Development of cooperatives
### drawbacks
- Fixing of land ceilings were ineffective since different states set different limits - Land and agriculture part of state list. 
	- India is a country where the average landholding for a household is less than 5 hectares land ceilings were fixed very high. e.g. in AP-27 to 300, Punjab 30-60 acres.
- ==The whole process of land reforms could benefit only 6% of the operated area with a negligible socio-economic impact.==
- Landlords being a dominant element acquired political control and colluded with the politicians and administration - parties such as the Swatantra and the BLd supported them.
- Judicial remedies were used to defer the implementation of the laws.
- Eviction of tenants and area brought under personal cultivation.
- Absence of land records.
- Large number of exceptions were created under the land ceiling law - which included plantation, estates, specialized farms etc.
- Long delay in bringing legislations in states - gave zamindars the time to evict tenants, register the land with others etc.
- Agrarian radicalism further weakened the movement.
### Cooperatives
- Nehru in the spirit of the Nagpur session called for the implementation of cooperativisation in the farming sector in India.
- Two types
	- Cooperative joint farms.
	- Service cooperatives
- Cooperative Joint Farms were promoted in the :
	- JC Kumarappa #committee.
	- Nagpur resolution
	- First Plan.
	- [[Community Development Programme (CDP)\|Community Development Programme (CDP)]]
- Limitations
	- Formed to evade land reforms.
	- State sponsored cooperative farms performed poorly.
	- Low agricultural credit were availed by many families and was deployed for non-agricultural purposes.
	- Landless and the poor remained largely excluded from this initiative
- But it was largely a failure, as India wanted to replicate China in this regard. But after the hostilities grew between both sides during the skirmishes in 1959 the plan was dropped. By the Third Plan, the idea of cooperativisation was dropped. 
- Swatantra Party was formed in August 1959 after the Nagpur resolution of the Congress which called for land ceilings, take-over of food grain trade by the state and adoption of cooperative farming. The party was led by old Congressmen like C. Rajagopalachari, K.M.Munshi, N.G.Ranga and Minoo Masani. The party stood out from the others in terms of its position on economic issues.
## Cooperative farming
- Cooperative farming is pooling of land and practicing joint agriculture. 
- Farmer remains the owner of his land. 
- Cooperative farming is not a new concept in India. Since ancient times, Indian farmers have been giving mutual aid to each other in weeding, harvesting etc.
### Benefits
1. As the size of farm increases, the per hectare cost of using tube-well, tractor comes down.
2. Solves the problem of sub-division and fragmentation of holdings.
	  (As per Agriculture Census, the average size of operational holdings has decreased from 2.28 hectares in 1970-71 to 1.08 hectares in 2015-16.)
3. Cooperative farm has more men and material resources to increase irrigation potential and land productivity. Members would not have been able to do it individually on their small farm.
4. Case studies generally point out that with cooperative farming, per acre production increases.
### Limitations of land cooperatives
1. Although village panchayat helped implementing cooperative farming, initial response was lukewarm.
2. In big cooperatives, big farmers would setup bogus cooperative farms by showing agricultural labourers as bogus members. This was done to evade land ceiling and tenancy reform laws. These big farmers were also able to get state subsidies such as fertilizers, seed, etc.
3. Even in genuine cooperative farming societies, the rich farmers dominated the management positions.
4. Some member farmers become lazy, thinking why bother when we will get the same amount of profit in proportion of the land owned.
5. In some state sponsored cooperatives, Government would allot land to the landless, SC/ST, displaced persons etc. But they did not get adequate support from government agencies for irrigation, electricity, seeds, fertilizer, etc.
### Limitations of service cooperatives
1. Leadership of the cooperatives consisted of leading families of the village which not only owned a great deal of land but also controlled trade and money lending.
2. These well to do families, were thus able to corner for themselves scarce agricultural inputs, including credit. In fact low interest agricultural credit made available through cooperative rural banks was used by such families for non-agricultural businesses, consumption and even money lending.
3. Cooperatives refused direct loans to cultivators and gave it to land owners. So this denied the land less from accessing credit. The cooperative credit societies, had faced huge defaulters, consequently, a very large percentage of over dues.
4. Yet, over time, the service cooperatives, particularly the credit cooperatives, performed a critical role for Indian agriculture. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) advanced loans.

## Land reform movements
### Bhoodan movement
- The Bhoodan Movement was a bold step towards solving the problems of landless labourers in a very peaceful manner. 
- The Bhoodan Movement was a glorious chapter in independent India. It marked a high watermark in political ethicality and morality in post Independence history. - Vedre Ramachandra Reddy was the first person to donate land.
#### What was the Bhoodan Movement about?
- The Bhoodan was a **Land Donation movement** led by **Vinoba Bhave** attempted to bring about a “*non-violent revolution*” in India’s [[GS 1/HISTORY/POST INDEPENDENCE/Land Reforms\|Land Reforms]] programme. 
- These integrated movements were an attempted to implement land reforms by urging the landed classes to voluntarily surrender a part of their land to the landless. 
- The Bhoodan was started in 1951. The movement was initiated from Pochampilli in present day Andhra Pradesh.
#### Philosophical underpinning
- Gandhian Ideal of [[Sarvodaya - the welfare of all\|Sarvodaya - the welfare of all]] – Gandhi’s idea of simple and pious life appealed to many. Gandhian ideal of Sarvodaya later became the ideological fountainhead of the movement. Sarvodaya meant “welfare for all”. 
- Many of the landlords voluntary gave up large parcel of land to help the landless labourers who were mostly from the economically backward, tribal and Dalit classes. It infused the spirit of sacrifice among the rich landlord class.
- ==Idea of Trusteeship or that all land belonged to God.==
- Spirit of ‘Ahimsa’- Bhave being a staunch Gandhian wanted to strictly keep the movement non-violent and voluntary in nature.
- Ancient Indian Spiritualism - Acharya Vinoba Bhave’s philosophy of Bhoodan was seated in the ancient Indian tradition of ‘danan’ or donation.
- Bhoodan movement was not only a land reform but ==a spiritual self purification spreading the message of Sarvodaya throughout the stretches of the country.==

#### Mechanism of Bhoodan movement
- Vinoba headed **Sarvodaya Samaj** was at top of the hierarchy which looked after the entire process. At the state level, there were **Pradesh Bhoodan committees** in each region. At grass root level, local committees and individual social workers.
- Bhoodan worker took help of Gram Panchayat, Patwari to survey the beneficiaries and land fertility. First preference given to landless agricultural labourers and then to farmers with insufficient land.
#### Successes of Bhoodan movement
- In the initial years the movement achieved a considerable degree of success, especially in North India-UP, Bihar by receiving over 4 million acres of land as donation by 1956. The movement was popularised in the belief that land is a gift of nature and it belonged to all.
- **People's movement**: This movement was un-official. The landlords were under no compulsion to donate their land, it was a voluntary movement. One of the very few attempts after independence to bring about land reform through a movement.
- Put pressure on landlords which provided fodder for the land reforms.
- Novel ideals like idea of Trusteeship promoted.
- Movement helped to reduce the gap between haves and have-nots in rural areas.
- Generated political activity towards the objective of land reforms - the Bhoodan and Gramdan movement stimulated political and other activity by the peasant masses has created a favourable atmosphere for political propaganda and agitation.
#### Impacts of Bhoodan movement
Despite its novel ideas the impacts of the movement was limited in many ways.
- After 1956 movement lost its momentum. While nearly 4.5 million acres of Bhoodan land was available, barely 0.65 million acres was actually distributed among 200,000 families. In some cases the donors took back their land from the Bhoodan workers for certain reasons.
- **Limited Geographical Reach** - Mainly confined to Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Central and India.
- **Donations of unsuitable land** - during the last years of the movement, many landowners donated tracts of land which were uncultivable and also under dispute.
- Withdrawal of Acharya Vinobha-by 1959 an ageing Bhave withdrew from the movement.
- Allotting authorities demanded petty money from the poor for recommending their names for allotment. As a result, many undeserving villagers also got land.
- In the later phase, Bhoodan workers got associated with one or another political parties. Some of them tried to use the Bhoodan organisation as a means to gain political clout and dividends at the time of election.
- Loss of political patronage-the political class had lost its interest a few years into the launch of the movement.
- Lack of an effective organization-the movement was spearheaded by Bhave and the Sarvodaya Trust which was a voluntary organization. During the later phase the Trust lost its focus and there was a leadership vacuum. Inability of the State Boodan Committees for the distribution of land in its hands. In Bihar this led to the committee being dismissed.
- Separation from mainstream government schemes-government led initiatives such as [[Community Development Programme (CDP)\|Community Development Programme (CDP)]] and land Reform legislation had no links with the Bhoodan movement.
- Mere allotment of land is insufficient. Because landless farmer also needed seeds, fertiliser, irrigation, which were not provided and land became useless for farmer which again mostly went back to landlord.
- The average size of land given was 0.5 to 3 acres which has resulted in land fragmentation, diseconomies of scale and disguised unemployment without any noticeable rise in agro-production. 
- Radical peasant movements.

The Bhoodan movement despite all its limitation was a moral victory. It raised awareness among the people and put pressure on the landlords to voluntarily donate land to the poor. The aspirations of its founders are still unmet but the spirit the movement infused can still be witnessed in the nation
### Gramdan movement
- Involved donation of a village, Gandhian idea that all land belonged to Gopal or God. Movement started in Orissa and became most successful there.
- 1952: by the village of Mongroth in U.P.1955: Orissa, Koraput district
- The basic aim and objectives of Gramdan movement are as follows:
	1. To bring about a social order based on equality of opportunities by ensuring balanced economic distribution.
	2. Non-violent Social transformations
#### Limitation of Gramdan
- Gramdan was successful mainly in villages where class differentiation had not yet emerged and there was little if any disparity in ownership of land or other property. Ex: Tribal villages.
2. But didn’t find cooperation from other villages in the plains or villages near urban centres.

# Green Revolution
Part of the New Agricultural Strategy (NAS). 
## Need for green revolution 
- Acute Shortage of food.
- Near famine like situation.
- Lean monsoon.
- Low production.
- War with China and Pakistan.
- Food for peace programme US Government assistance reduced.

## Course of action
- It was decided to put more resources into those areas which already had irrigation and those farmers who were already well off. 
- The argument was that those who already had the capacity could help increase production rapidly in the short run. 
- Thus the government offered high yielding variety seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and better irrigation at highly subsidised prices. 
- The government also gave a guarantee to buy the produce of the farmers at a given price. This is how the system of [[Minimum Support Price (MSP)\|Minimum Support Price (MSP)]] evolved in India.
## Components of green revolution
- Introduction of HYVs - Mexican dwarf wheat.
- Use of chemical fertilizers.
- Insecticides and pesticides.
- Enhancing irrigation facilities.
- Chemical herbicides and weedicides.
- Mechanization of agriculture.
- Advanced personnel.
- Introduction of Agricultural prices commission.
- Cooperative societies.
- government investment grew substantially in agriculture.
- Encouraging the strategy of procurement.
## Success of green revolution
- Substantially increased production -by 1984 India had started to have surplus.
- Increasing productivity.
- Increase in farm income and lifting from poverty.
## Limitations
- Regional and inter-personal inequality.
	- The Green revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities. Only certain regions such as the Punjab, western UP, coastal Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Tamil Nadu, received the first wave of the Green Revolution package.
		- Why did the Green Revolution in India virtually by-pass the eastern region despite fertile soil and good availability of water? #PYMQ, 2014
	- The Green revolution also increased income disparities. 
		- The introduction of machinery led to the displacement of the service caste groups who used to carry out these agriculture related activities. 
		- This process of displacement also increased the pace of rural-urban migration.
- Ecological damages.
	- Degradation of soil fertility
	- Water table falling down: HYV seeds require reliable water sources. As well as being expensive, in some cases where inappropriate schemes were used salinisation became a problem. 
	- Dam construction in some areas also resulted in the flooding of some good farming land.
	- Pollution and environmental degradation: . The large amounts of fertilisers and pesticides required by the HYVs also led to serious environmental problems as they entered water supplies.
- Increase of toxic level in food chain.
- Increase in input cost: For many farmers the cost of machinery was too much and they simply couldn’t afford it. Many very poor farmers with little money to buy even the new seeds or fertiliser that was required.
- Rural indebtness: Many farmers who had tried to take on the new technologies became heavily in debt, leading to increase stress and in some instances suicide.
- Growth in [[Inequality\|Inequality]]. 
	- The rich peasants and the large landholders were the major beneficiaries of the process.
	- Landowners began to take back land from their tenants and cultivate it directly because cultivation was becoming more profitable. This made the rich farmers better off and worsened the condition of the landless and marginal holders
- Unemployment: In areas where there was an increase in mechanisation, there was an increase in unemployment with fewer people needed to do the jobs that were now done using tractors etc.
- Focused on cereals - cereal centric, negative impact on pulses, oilseeds, maize, barley etc.
- Loss of traditional seed varieties: Many traditional varieties of seeds that were developed over the centuries by farmers, is being lost as hybrid, high-yielding, and genetically modified varieties of seeds are being promoted as more productive and scientific.
## Second Green revolution
- Second Green revolution should aim at promoting sustainable livelihood, enabling the poor to come out of poverty by generating gainful self-employment.
- While the first Green revolution aimed at undertaking mass agricultural production, the second Green Revolution should be to promote agricultural production by the masses. This is the Gandhian approach to equitable sharing of prosperity by involving the poor in development.

# EMERGENCY
- The Emergency provisions are contained in Part XVIII of the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/CONSTITUTION BOC\|Constitution]].
- Normal democratic functioning resumed within a short span of time after emergency. Thus one lesson of emergency is that it is extremely difficult to do away with democracy in India.
- It brought out some ambiguities regarding the emergency provision in the Constitution that have been rectified now.
- The emergency made everyone more aware of the value of civil liberties. The Courts too, have taken an active role after the emergency in protecting the civil liberties of the individuals. This is a response to the inability of the judiciary to protect civil liberties effectively during the emergency. Many civil liberty organisations came up after this experience.
- Many issues that emerged during emergency still remain. There is a tension between routine functioning of a democratic government and the continuous political protests by parties and groups. The actual implementation of the emergency rule took place through the **police and the administration**. These institutions could not function independently. They ==were turned into political instruments of the ruling party==.
- [[Forty fourth Amendment Act, 1978#Forty fourth Amendment Act 1978\|Forty fourth Amendment Act]], 1978 provided that [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS\|FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS]] under Article 20 and 21 cannot be suspended during the National Emergency.

# Operation Flood

- Operation Flood, launched in 1970, was a project of India's **National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)**, which was the ==world's biggest dairy development program.==
- It transformed India from a milk-deficient nation into the world's largest milk producer, surpassing the USA in 1998, with about 17 percent of global output in 2010–11. 
- In 30 years it doubled milk available per person, and made dairy farming India’s largest self-sustainable rural employment generator.
- It was launched to help farmers direct their own development, placing control of the resources they create in their own hands. All this was ==achieved not merely by mass production, but by production by the masses.==
- **The Anand pattern of experiment at Amul**, a single, cooperative dairy, was the engine behind the success of the program.
- [[Verghese Kurien\|Verghese Kurien]], the chairman and founder of Amul, was named the chairman of NDDB by the then Prime Minister of India [[Shashtri years\|Lal Bahadur Shastri]]. Kurien gave the necessary thrust using his professional management skills to the program, and is recognized as its architect. 
- ==Operation Flood is the program behind "the white revolution."== It created a national milk grid linking producers throughout India with consumers in over 700 towns and cities, reducing seasonal and regional price variations while ensuring that the producer gets a major share of the price consumers pay, by cutting out middlemen.
- Operation flood gave more emphasis to high yielding imported breeds than native breeds.
- The bedrock of Operation Flood has been village milk producers' co-operatives, which procure milk and provide inputs and services, making modern management and technology available to members. 
- Operation Flood's objectives included: 
	- Increase milk production ("a flood of milk")
	- Augment rural incomes
	- Fair prices for consumers
	- Increase milk supply and production
	- Greater income for farmers and increase in productivity
		- larger number of farmers included dairy farming to augment their income, 
		- Benefitted the poor
	- Indigenous dairy manufacturing industry
	- Empowerment of women-AMUL coordinated with SHGs like Sewa to organize women cooperatives.

## AMUL experiment
- Started in 1946 as Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union Ltd(1946) later renamed as Anand Milk Union Ltd or Gujarat Cooperative Milk Federation.
- Important figures-**Tribhuvandas Patel** and Varghese Kurien-played a role in organizing the cooperative and attracting farmers to the fold
- Farming income increased and marketing of milk was being done in an effective way. Insurance was provided.
- As the cooperative grew it greatly diversified-they entered into manufacturing and food processing where milk powder, ghee products, butter etc were being made
- Also they started manufacturing units for vaccines etc.

### Characteristics
- Democratic mode of functioning
- Inclusive-all castes and classes are included
- Adoption of technology-software etc.
- Bottom-up planning where the producer is consulted for each decision.

To replicate the Anand Pattern NDDB was established in 1965. 
Located in Anand.

## White revolution
- Amul spurred India’s milk revolution which made the country the world’s largest producer of milk and milk products. In the process Amul became the largest food brand in India and has ventured into markets overseas. 
- It started in Gujarat as a response to the exploitation of marginal milk producers by traders or agents. Agents paid very little to producers and made huge profits by selling the milk in Bombay city. Then a cooperative of milk producers was formed to collect, process and sell milk.
### Approach
- A crucial feature is **democratic mode of functioning of the cooperatives**, with a conscious effort being made to not over look the interest of land less and low caste.
- Milk production drastically increased, so the union **diversified its activities**. It started manufacturing milk powder, butter, cheese and baby food. It became first brand in the entire world to manufacture these products on commercial scale.
- **Computer technology was utilised** by the union to do cost-benefit analysis of prices of various inputs which go into cattle feed and provide cattle a optimum mix of nutritious food.
- An **efficient artificial insemination service** through the village society workers was introduced so that producers could improve the quality of stock. Vaccines were manufactured for the cattle. **High quality fodder**, seed for producing green fodder were made available.
- A **regular news letter was published** in an effort to educate the peasants about modern development in animal husbandry. Women who looked after the animals in households were educated.
- **Institute of Rural Management (IRMA)** was founded in Anand for training professional managers for [[Rural Development\|Rural Development]] projects using AMUL as a live laboratory.
### Impact
- The country’s milk production and incomes of milk producers significantly raised. AMUL is available today in over 40 countries of the world. AMUL is exporting a wide variety of products which include whole and skimmed milk powder, cottage cheese, Ghee and indigenous sweets.
- The chief beneficiaries were marginal or landless. It saw dairying as a path to development, for generating employment and income for rural households and alleviating poverty.
- A by-product of the industry has been indigenous dairy equipment industry and an impressive body of indigenous expertise that include animal nutrition, animal health, artificial insemination, management information systems, dairy engineering food technology, etc.
- Operation flood in cooperation with women NGO, such as SEWA, established about 6000 women cooperatives. This gave women their financial autonomy to generate more income outside their homes.
- Anand pattern was not limited to milk alone, cooperatives of fruits and vegetables, oilseed cultivators, etc. were organised similarly by NDDB.

# Panchsheel principles
Framing an independent foreign policy in troubled times as the [[Cold War\|cold war]] had already began.
- Ideas of pacifism and world peace as envisaged in the Gandhian mass movements. The ideals of the Panchsheel and non-align movement are inspired from the noble tenets of the freedom struggle.
- First these principles were used in 1954, when India signed an agreement with China which is realted to trade in Tibet.
- Later used by Sukarno, modified version by PVNR. 
- Tribal Panchsheel, new version by Modi.

## Panchsheel
- Panchsheel principles are a set of principles to govern relations between states. These principles were born to ensure a world where nations can co-exist and prosper together in peace and harmony.
- An underlying assumption of the five principles was that newly independent states after decolonisation would be able to develop a new and more principled approach to international relations. The five principles of Panchsheel provide a basis for not only interstate relations but also the construction of a new international order.

### Five principles of Panchsheel
1. Mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
2. Mutual non-aggression.
3. Mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.
4. Equality and cooperation for mutual benefit.
5. Peaceful coexistence.
### Relevance of Panchsheel
- Guiding tool in India’s relation with its neighbours. Eg: [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/BASICS OF FOREIGN POLICY#Gujral Doctrine I K Gujral-1996\|Gujral Doctrine]] is based on Panchsheel principles.
- India’s relation with countries are guided by this principle – eg: In Africa, Latin America etc. difference between Indian and Chinese  Intention in these markets.
- India still follow non-alignment principle which is guided by the Panchsheel principles to develop a framework for equitable globalization and genuine multilateralism
- Panchsheel could act as a catalyst to better coordinate efforts, enhance mutual understanding, share developmental experiences and tackle trans-national threats more effectively.

### Why it is not relevant?
- Change of circumstances - emerging threats like Terrorism
- Ideal philosophy which is not practical now. Many violations by other countries. Eg: China violated the Panchsheel principle back in 1962.

### New Panchsheel 
Concept evolved by Manmohan Singh – (not a govt policy though) Replacement of current 5 principles with new 5 principles
1. More emphasis on economic diplomacy – to achieve national interest.
2. Developmental priorities should determine its engagement.
3. Multi alignment from non-alignment
4. Greater importance to regional cooperation
5. Linkages with world’s major economies

# PUNJAB CRISIS
## Khalistan movement
>Khalistan movement was a separatist movement for a Sikh homeland. Roots of Khalistan movement are found in the various developments in Punjab region since independence in 1947. #introduction 
### Causes of Khalistan movement
- Partition excesses: The various riots and the excesses suffered by Sikh community during Partition of India, made them to feel isolated. Development of feeling of communal fear from the other religious communities.
- Language Politics: During 1950s whole India came under the demand for reorganisation of states on linguistic basis. On language, one group was demanding Punjabi other for Hindi. Even question of script became an issue.
- Communal Politics: Communal politicians from both communities made this religious issue, which further enhanced hostility between community. In the late 1970s, a series of clashes erupted among Sikhs, Nirankaris and Hindus. The injustice rallied the Sikhs behind **Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale** call for retribution and revenge spread.
	- Shiromani Akalidal played for political gains and through the **Anandpur Sahib Resolution (1973)**  they demanded for an autonomous region for Sikhs.
- Centralisation: Over centralisation of polity has led to resentment among the state. This contributed towards challenging central authority and rising prestige of Bhindranwale.
- Economic: Green revolution, migration of labourers, lack of industrialisation in Punjab has all led to strengthening the movement.
## Green revolution and Punjab crisis
- Green Revolution in India began in the 1960s, through the introduction of high-yield crop varieties and application of modern agricultural techniques, and led to an increase in food production in India. The impact of Green revolution was most prominent in Punjab which came to be known as the *granary of India*.
- It led to increased prosperity in the countryside among farmers. At the same time, it contributed to increased westernisation of Punjabi society. Demand for status items such as TVs, radios and motorbikes increased among the newly rich. At the same time, social evils such as alcoholism and drugs consumption also increased in the wake of green revolution.
- Thus, a fear arose among orthodox sections that Punjabi society, especially its youth, was losing its touch with religious values. To counter the westernising tendency, religious revival movements sprung up in Punjab. The movements aim was to rid Punjabi society of the evils brought about by increased westernisation and to instill religious values among the youth.
- In the 1970s, Punjabi society also faced an economic crisis due to stagnating agricultural yields and increased migration by labourers from other states, which led to conflict between them and the poorer sections of Punjabi society. To this, the problem of youth unemployment can also be added. Due to its strategic location on the Pakistan border, the Indian government had consciously avoided setting up many industries in Punjab.
- These movements now started advocating the idea of an independent Sikh nation, which could be freed from outside religious and cultural influences.

## Operation blue star
- **Operation Blue Star** was a military operation to remove Sikh militants who were amassing weapons in the [[Golden temple complex in Amritsar\|Golden temple complex in Amritsar]].
- The roots of operation Blue Star can be traced from the Khalistan Movement. The Khalistan Movement was a political Sikh nationalist movement that wanted to create an independent state for Sikh people, inside the current North-Western Republic of India.
- The terrorists bullied the press and judiciary, they killed the police officials and those suspected of cooperating with the police and administration, they issued successful diktats to administrators to do their bidding, they collected parallel taxes, they silenced intellectuals and political workers, coerced peasants in giving them shelter.
- This all were designed not only to facilitate their activities but also to convince the people of Punjab that they had the capacity to challenge the Indian state and that they were the rulers of tomorrow. These terrorists were eliminated through operation blue star.
### Criticism
- The use of artillery in the congested inner city of Amritsar proved deadly to many civilian bystanders living near Harmandir Sahib.
- The media blackout throughout the Punjab resulted in widespread doubt regarding the official stories and aided many rumour.
- The choice of time of attack by Government, the heavy casualties, the loss of property, and allegations of human rights violations by army personnel. S. K. Sinha, the GOC of the Indian Army who was sacked just before the attack, had advised the government against the operation.
- The timing of operation blue star coincided with a Sikh religious day. The Sikhs from all over the world visit the temple on this day. So, the casualties inflicted on Sikhs were maximum.
- During the operation, a number of Sikh literature were destroyed and the temple itself bore the brunt of armed attacks. Innocent boys were allegedly rounded up all over the state with the ostensible reason of attacking terrorism.
## Peace afterwards
- In July 1985, Rajiv Gandhi reached an agreement with Harchand Singh Longowal, then the President of the Akali Dal. This agreement, known as the **Rajiv Gandhi - Longowal Accord** or the **Punjab Accord**, was a step towards bringing normalcy to Punjab.
- It was agreed that Chandigarh would be transferred to Punjab, a separate commission would be appointed to resolve the border dispute between Punjab and Haryana, and a tribunal would be set up to decide the sharing of Ravi-Beas river water among Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.
- The agreement also provided for compensation to and better treatment of those affected by the militancy in Punjab and the withdrawal of the application of AFSPA act in Punjab.
- However, peace did not come easily or immediately. The cycle of violence continued nearly for a decade. Militancy and counter insurgency violence led to excesses by the police and violations of human rights.
- The central government had to impose President’s rule in the State and the normal electoral and political process was suspended. Militancy was eventually eradicated by the security forces.

## Reasons for revival of Khalistan Movement
- Revival in Canada and UK, and in countries like USA, Australia, Germany, Italy etc. 
	- Referendum 2020, movements like Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) and Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF)
- The emergence of a self-styled Sikh extremist preacher, Amritpal Singh, modelling himself on Bhindranwale
- Rise of social media and [[Radicalisation\|radicalisation]]
- Agrarian crisis, violent protest against farm laws in January 2021
- Drug crisis
- Possibility of a foreign conspiracy - Support from Pakistan - Pakistan’s Inter­ Services Intelligence (ISI). Kartarpur corridor is called as Khalistan corridor by some.

## Crime Rate in NDPS Act Cases in Punjab 
- In 2020, Punjab took the top place in the country with a 22.9% crime rate (per lakh population) in cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. 
- Out of 6,909 cases registered across Punjab, 4,039 were for possession of drugs for trafficking and 2,870 for possession of drugs for personal consumption, according to 'Crime in India 2020,' released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

# NORTH EAST PROBLEM
>The North Eastern region of India is plagued by instability, insurgency and social unrest since India’s Independence.  #introduction 
- In this extremely diverse and strategically sensitive region, there are different reasons for the ethnic upsurges and insurgencies in different states. Some seek secession from the Indian Union, some others seek separate states and yet others greater autonomy within the existing state.
- About 99 percent of the border of this region is international border.
- North-East India covers 8 percent of the country’s total area and has 4 percent of the national population.
- Insurgency related incidents in the NE decreased from 824 in 2014 to 158 in 2022. Compared to the year 2014, there is a reduction of 76% in extremist incidents in the year 2022. Similarly, the casualties of security personnel and civilians have come down by 90% and 97% respectively in 2022 as compared to 2014. #facts
- From 2014 till now, more than 8000 insurgents have surrendered. The disturbed areas under Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) have been completely withdrawn from Tripura (2015) and Meghalaya (2018) and significantly reduced in Nagaland, Assam and Manipur.
- ![Pasted image 20230223130655.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230223130655.png)
## Reasons for insurgency in NE
### Historical Factors
- Most of the Indian Empires were separated from NE. It became connected to mainland only after the advent of British.
- Even National Movement did not penetrate well into the NE region.
- Migration of Bengali speaking population.
- The Tribals of the North-East region were afraid of losing their identity.
### Geographical Factors
- Relative isolation with mainland India.
- International porous borders. e.g., Indian borders with countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh.
- Dense forest cover provide a platform for insurgents to conduct guerilla warfare against security forces.
- Extreme weather in some regions.
- Proximity to the Golden triangle ensures funding for separatist/secessionist organisations via support of illegal drug smuggling.
### Political Factors
- [[Linguistic Reorganization and Formation of States\|Linguistic Reorganization and Formation of States]] related issues.
	- At independence, entire region except Manipur and Tripura comprised State of Assam. Demands for political autonomy arose when non-Assamese felt that Assam government was imposing Assamese language on them.
- [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/OTHER/SCHEDULED AREAS AND TRIBAL AREAS\|5th and 6th schedules]], [[Panchayat extension act (PESA)\|PESA]] implementation issues.
- The collective strength of the Northeast States in the Lok Sabha is 24 in a 543 member house, and this has led to a neglect of issues relating to this region.
- Implementation of [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Various security forces, agencies and their mandate#AFSPA\|AFSPA]]
	- Gives immunity to soldiers against criminal offences too
	- Soldiers can raid households even at night
	- Even if there is a perceived threat, army men can shoot
### Development/Governance deficits
- Lack of industrial development: More than 75% of the population relies on primary sector.
- Poor infrastructural facilities
- Weak political and administrative machinery
### Role of external actors
- Create geo-strategic instability in the region
- Supply of arms and ammunition
- Militant groups get safe haven in China and Myanmar border.
- Financial support
- Denial of Indian Sovereignty.
- Instability in Myanmar.
## Major security issues in NE
### Secession demands
#### Insurgency in Assam
- In Assam the **problem began in 1979,** the indigenous people of Assam demanded that illegal immigrants who had emigrated from Bangladesh to Assam be detected and deported. The movement led by **All Assam Students Union** began non-violently with satyagraha, boycotts, picketing and courting arrest.
- The Election in 1983 was opposed by the movement’s leaders. The election led to widespread violence. The movement finally ended after an agreement with the central government on August 15, 1985. (**Assam Accord**)
- Under the provisions of this accord, anyone who entered the state illegally between January 1966 and March 1971 was allowed to remain but was disenfranchised for 10 years, while those who entered after 1971 face expulsion.
##### Emergence of Insurgency
- The **United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA),** an insurgent group, was formed in 1979 and marked the beginning of insurgency in Assam. The main aim of ULFA was to **“liberate Assam through armed struggle from the exploitative attitude of the central government towards Assam and establish a sovereign independent Assam.”**
- The group **remained dormant**  during the Assam movement; however, it supported the Assam movement. The Assam movement was against the illegal migrants. ULFA also raised the similar issue, which gained popularity and acceptability of the common population.
##### Issue of NRC
- Bangladeshi immigrants had affected the demography of Assam.
- NRC is an exercise first carried out 1951 to enumerate the citizens, their houses and holdings. 
- It is an official record of all the legal citizens of a state in respect of each village showing the houses or holdings in a serial order and indicating against each house or holding the number and names of persons staying therein. 
- Over the years there has been a demand from the indigenous Assamese groups to update the NRC.
#### Nagalim insurgency
- The Nagas were the inhabitants of the Naga hills along the Northeast frontier on the Assam-Burma border. 
- The Nagas are not a single tribe, but an ethnic community that comprises several tribes who live in the state of Nagaland and its neighbourhood.
- In 1946 came the **Naga National Council (NNC)**, which, under the leadership of **Angami Zapu Phizo**, declared Nagaland an independent state on August 14, 1947.
- The first and the most significant insurgency started in Nagaland under the leadership of Phizo in the early 1950.
- The NNC resolved to establish a “sovereign Naga state” and conducted a “referendum” in 1951, in which “99 percent” supported an “independent” Nagaland.
- In 1952, Phizo formed the underground Naga Federal Government (NFG) and the Naga Federal Army (NFA). The Government of India sent in the Army to crush the insurgency and, in 1958, enacted the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. 
- Insurgents aims to establish a ‘**Greater Nagaland** (‘Nagalim’ or the People’s Republic of Nagaland) based on  **Mao Tse Tung’s ideology**. Its manifesto is based on the principle of Socialism for economic development.
	- A “Greater Nagalim” comprising **“all contiguous Naga-inhabited areas”,**  along with Nagaland. That included **several districts of Assam, Arunachal and Manipur**, as also a  **large tract of Myanmar**.
	- The map of “Greater Nagalim” has about 1,20,000 sq km, while the state of Nagaland consists of 16,527 sq km. The claims have always kept Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh wary of a peace settlement that might affect their territories.
- The Nagaland Assembly has endorsed the ‘Greater Nagalim’ demand – **“Integration of all Naga Inhabited contiguous areas under one administrative umbrella”** – as many as five times: in December 1964, August 1970, September 1994, December 2003 and as recently as on July 27, 2015.
- **Shillong Accord in 1975** made the NNC laid down its arms and signed a Peace Agreement with Government of India.
- The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) was formed on January 31, 1980 by Isak Chisi Swu, Thuingaleng Muivah and S.S. Khaplang to  **opposed the ‘Shillong Accord’**  signed by the then NNC (Naga National Council) with the Indian government. 
- Later, differences surfaced within the outfit over the issue of commencing a dialogue process with the Indian Government and on April 30, 1988, the NSCN split into two factions, namely the NSCN-K led by S S Khaplang, and the NSCN-IM, led by Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah.
##### Peace efforts
- Nine Point Agreement
	- Signed by the governor of Assam and Naga leaders on June 26, 1947.
	- Under this agreement it was decided that the Nagas would be granted judicial, executive, and legislative powers, as well as autonomy in land related matters.
	- There was a 10 year guarantee of these provisions at the end of which the Nagas could choose between extending the agreement or a new agreement.
	- The Naga leaders were also promised unification of Naga territories from nearby districts into the Naga hill district.
	- However, the constituent Assembly refused to ratify this accord.
- Sixteen-point Agreement with the Naga People’s Convention of 1960.
- Shillong Accord of 1975.
- **Naga Peace Accord 2015**:
	- Nagaland peace accord is the accord signed in August 2015 by the Government of India and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) to end the insurgency.
	- The framework agreement is based on the “**unique**” history of Nagas and recognises the universal principle that in a democracy sovereignty lies with the people.
	- National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) has given up its demand for ‘Greater Nagaland’ and vowed allegiance to the constitution of India. The details of the accord are yet to come in public domain.
	- The Government of India has also made clear that existing boundaries of states will not be altered.
	- It will restore peace and pave the way for prosperity in the North East.
	- It will advance a life of dignity, opportunity and equity for the Naga people, based on their genius and consistent with the uniqueness of the Naga people and their culture and traditions.
	- The Government of India recognized the unique history, culture and position of the Nagas and their sentiments and aspirations. The NSCN understood and appreciated the Indian political system and governance.
	- The Nagas peace accord has been hanging fire since a framework agreement was signed with NSCN-IM in 2015. Naga groups even carried out a rally in Delhi demanding early finalisation of Naga Peace Accord.
#### Manipur insurgency
- Manipur was declared a  **separate state in 1972.**
- The Manipur people are grouped into three communities,  **Meitei, Nagas and Kuki or Chins.**  Meitei live in plain, while Nagas and kukis are in the hill district.
- There were many tensions between the different tribal groups in the state.
- The emergence of insurgency in Manipur is formally traced to the emergence of the **United National Liberation Front (UNLF) in 1964**.
- Since then several other outfits, like the  **People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of Manipur, founded in 1978, People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) set up in 1977 and the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP)**  that came into being in April, 1980 have emerged in the valley areas consisting of four districts of the State.
- The situation is further complicated because as, violence by the **Naga groups has also spilled over into Manipur, a substantial part of which is claimed by the Isak-Muivah faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) as part of Nagalim or Greater Nagaland**, the proposed unified territory of the Nagas as claimed by the Naga rebels. Several clashes between the NSCN-IM and the Khaplang faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K) have been reported from the hill districts of the State.
- **Manipur had been declared a ‘disturbed area’ in its entirety in 1980 and the Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA), 1958 was imposed in the State on 8 September, 1980, which continues to be in place till now**. 
- The implementation of this Act resulted in the State witnessing an unprecedented civic uprising, including the infamous **“mothers’ nude protest”** and  **Irom Sharmila Hunger strike against the Act**. The AFSPA is still embroiled in controversy and the people of Manipur are continuing their protest against the Act.
- Manipur witnessed a series of protests starting in July 2015, following demands for the implementation of the **Inner Line Permit (ILP)** system in the State. 
- The protesters have demanded that the government introduce the ILP bill in the State Assembly. 
	- Manipur, along with Dimapur district of Nagaland, was brought under the purview of the [[ILP System\|ILP System]] in December 2019.
		- Dimapur was the only place in Nagaland which was not under the ILP system because the district is a commercial hub and has a mixed population (often referred to as ‘Mini India’).
	- The system is in force in the neighbouring States of Nagaland and Mizoram and also in Arunachal Pradesh.
#### Insurgency in Mizoram
- Large scale disturbances broke out on 28th February 1966 government installations at Aizawl, Lunglei, Chawngte, Chhimluang and other places simultaneously under the **Mizo National Front (MNF)** led by **Laldenga** with the specified goal of achieving sovereign independence of **Greater Mizoram**.
- Government had to use Air Force to fight the insurgents. (first ever incident)
- The Mizo National Front was outlawed in 1967.
- The demand for statehood has gained fresh momentum. A Mizo District Council delegation, which met prime Minister Indira Gandhi in May 1971 demanded a full-fledged state for the Mizos. 
- The union government on its own offered the proposal of turning Mizo Hills into a Union Territory in July 1971. The Mizo leaders were ready to accept the offer on condition that the status of U.T would be upgraded to statehood sooner rather than later. 
- The Union Territory of Mizoram came into being on 21st January, 1972. Mizoram got two seats in Parliament, one each in the Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha.
- In June **1986**, the centre signed a peace agreement (**Mizo Accord**) with Laldenga, leader of the Mizo National Front (MNF). By its terms, the MNF rebels laid down their arms and were granted amnesty against prosecution. The government granted full statehood to Mizoram.
- Among the ethnic and secessionist conflicts, the resolution of the Mizoram issue was a notable success.
#### Insurgency in Tripura
- The state of Tripura  **witnessed a surge in terrorist activities in the 1990s.**  The main reason was the influx of refugees from the newly formed Bangladesh.
- **Influx of refugees**  fuelled discontent and demographic inversion in Tripura.
- This led to insurgent activities in the state of Tripura and the formation of the **Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti (TUJS)** in 1971, followed by the Tripura National Volunteers (TNV) in 1981.
- The  **National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT)** was formed on March 2, 1989 and its armed wing, the National Holy Army and All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF), in July 1990, queered the pitch.
- But today Tripura is **one of the successful states in curbing insurgency**  in the state.
##### Famous Tripura model
- A multidimensional and fine-tuned solution provided by the government of Tripura. 
- Working on all these multiple fronts Tripura succeeded in fighting against the insurgency.
### Statehood demands
- General reasons behind their demand of separate statehood:
	- To preserve and promote their ethnic identity
	- For better benefits economic development in backward areas
	- To ensure control over natural resources like land
#### Bodoland
- **Bodos, the largest plains tribe of Assam** started an armed struggle for a separate state in the mid-1980s. This armed struggle led to ethnic cleansing of the non-Bodos along the north bank of Brahmaputra.
- Bodoland Movement for an independent state of Bodoland started on March 2, 1987 under the leadership of **Upendranath Brahma** of the **All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU)**.

## Challenges in NE insurgency
- Multiple groups with varying ideologies and often conflicting aims, which makes political negotiations difficult.
- Factionalism within the groups.
- Weak political machinery of the state.

- Article 371A Special status to Nagaland
- 6th Schedule - AMTM states- Assam, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya.
	- which protected not only the tribal laws, customs and land rights; but also gave sufficient autonomy to the tribes to administer themselves with minimum outside interference.
- Assam Accord, Mizo Accord, Bodo Accord etc.
- Amnesty Schemes by MHA.
- **Protected Area Permit**: Due to security reasons, certain areas have been declared as Protected Area/Restricted Areas where no foreigner can enter or stay without obtaining permit from the competent authorities.
- Inner Line Permit
### Developmental Measures
- Ministry of DoNER - Development of North Eastern States.
- Border Area development Project
- Hill Area Development Programme
- North Eastern Council
- Non Lapsable Central Pool of Resources - NLCPR
- Specific Accelerated Road Development Programme SARDP
- PM Special Package for Development in North east
- North East Industrial & Investment Promotion Policy
- External Aid from World Bank, ADB

- Look East/Act East Policy
	- Trade
	- Tourism
	- Connectivity
		- Kaladan Multimodal Project
		- LEDO road
		- India Thailand Myanmar trilateral highway
#### Development projects in NE with the involvement of other countries
- **Trilateral Highway: India-Myanmar-Thailand (IMT)** 
- **Kaladan Project**
	- Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project involving India and Myanmar is very important for connecting the North East and Myanmar. This is part of India’s **‘Look East policy’** connecting north eastern States and the ASEAN region.
- India is also involved in developing the **Sittwe Port in Myanmar** which is expected to emerge as the most strategic overseas port for India and is located at the estuary of Kaladan River which is in the troubled Rakhine province of Myanmar.
- **Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Corridor**
- **Rail link from Agartala-Akhaura**
### Security Measures
- India has applied hard power to tackle terrorism in the Northeast. ‘**Operation Bajrang**’, and ‘**Operation Rhino**’ were launched to put down the violent activities of ULFA between 1990 to 1992.
- More recently, in 2015, ‘**Operation All Out**’ was conducted against Bodo militant groups.
- SRE scheme
- CIAT schools
- CIJW schools (**Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare schools**)
- **Unified Command Structure (UCS)** - Army, state police force and central police forces work in a combined way. Mainly in Assam and in J&K recently.
- Border fencing activities along Bangladesh border.
#### Security Cooperation With Neighbouring Countries
- **The Myanmar government handed over at least 22 militants**  of north-eastern armed groups to India.
- **The Royal Bhutan Army had conducted an ‘Operation All Clear’** to flush out camps set up on its soil by north-eastern armed groups, including the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) at the Indian government’s request, the Bangladesh government – between 2009 and 2015 – had handed over the top leaders of ULFA (barring Paresh Barua) and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), forcing them to come to the table for peace talks.
- The armies of India and Myanmar have launched two phases of joint operations along the Myanmar border targeting camps of insurgent groups operating in North East. Named **Operation Sunrise** the strategy is aimed at hitting militant groups that are impacting both India and Myanmar.

>The North East's challenges require a multifaceted approach, including political negotiations, socio-economic development, and robust security measures, combined with cooperation among neighbouring nations.  From being on the margins of the India story, the Northeast should quickly transformed into one of the country’s growth engines. #conclusion 
## #PYMQ on insurgencies in NE
- Cross-Border movement of insurgents is only one of the several security challenges facing the policing of the border in North-East India. Examine the various challenges currently emanating across the India-Myanmar border. Also, discuss the steps to counter the challenges. (2019)
- The north-eastern region of India has been infested with insurgency for a very long time. Analyze the major reasons for the survival of armed insurgency in this region. (2017)
- Human rights activists constantly highlight the view that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) is a draconian act leading to cases of human rights abuses by the security forces. What sections of AFSPA are opposed by the activists? Critically evaluate the requirement with reference to the view held by the Apex Court. (2015)

# Popular movements in Post Independent India
## Land reform movements
### Bhoodan movement
- The Bhoodan Movement was a bold step towards solving the problems of landless labourers in a very peaceful manner. 
- The Bhoodan Movement was a glorious chapter in independent India. It marked a high watermark in political ethicality and morality in post Independence history. - Vedre Ramachandra Reddy was the first person to donate land.
#### What was the Bhoodan Movement about?
- The Bhoodan was a **Land Donation movement** led by **Vinoba Bhave** attempted to bring about a “*non-violent revolution*” in India’s [[GS 1/HISTORY/POST INDEPENDENCE/Land Reforms\|Land Reforms]] programme. 
- These integrated movements were an attempted to implement land reforms by urging the landed classes to voluntarily surrender a part of their land to the landless. 
- The Bhoodan was started in 1951. The movement was initiated from Pochampilli in present day Andhra Pradesh.
#### Philosophical underpinning
- Gandhian Ideal of [[Sarvodaya - the welfare of all\|Sarvodaya - the welfare of all]] – Gandhi’s idea of simple and pious life appealed to many. Gandhian ideal of Sarvodaya later became the ideological fountainhead of the movement. Sarvodaya meant “welfare for all”. 
- Many of the landlords voluntary gave up large parcel of land to help the landless labourers who were mostly from the economically backward, tribal and Dalit classes. It infused the spirit of sacrifice among the rich landlord class.
- ==Idea of Trusteeship or that all land belonged to God.==
- Spirit of ‘Ahimsa’- Bhave being a staunch Gandhian wanted to strictly keep the movement non-violent and voluntary in nature.
- Ancient Indian Spiritualism - Acharya Vinoba Bhave’s philosophy of Bhoodan was seated in the ancient Indian tradition of ‘danan’ or donation.
- Bhoodan movement was not only a land reform but ==a spiritual self purification spreading the message of Sarvodaya throughout the stretches of the country.==

#### Mechanism of Bhoodan movement
- Vinoba headed **Sarvodaya Samaj** was at top of the hierarchy which looked after the entire process. At the state level, there were **Pradesh Bhoodan committees** in each region. At grass root level, local committees and individual social workers.
- Bhoodan worker took help of Gram Panchayat, Patwari to survey the beneficiaries and land fertility. First preference given to landless agricultural labourers and then to farmers with insufficient land.
#### Successes of Bhoodan movement
- In the initial years the movement achieved a considerable degree of success, especially in North India-UP, Bihar by receiving over 4 million acres of land as donation by 1956. The movement was popularised in the belief that land is a gift of nature and it belonged to all.
- **People's movement**: This movement was un-official. The landlords were under no compulsion to donate their land, it was a voluntary movement. One of the very few attempts after independence to bring about land reform through a movement.
- Put pressure on landlords which provided fodder for the land reforms.
- Novel ideals like idea of Trusteeship promoted.
- Movement helped to reduce the gap between haves and have-nots in rural areas.
- Generated political activity towards the objective of land reforms - the Bhoodan and Gramdan movement stimulated political and other activity by the peasant masses has created a favourable atmosphere for political propaganda and agitation.
#### Impacts of Bhoodan movement
Despite its novel ideas the impacts of the movement was limited in many ways.
- After 1956 movement lost its momentum. While nearly 4.5 million acres of Bhoodan land was available, barely 0.65 million acres was actually distributed among 200,000 families. In some cases the donors took back their land from the Bhoodan workers for certain reasons.
- **Limited Geographical Reach** - Mainly confined to Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Central and India.
- **Donations of unsuitable land** - during the last years of the movement, many landowners donated tracts of land which were uncultivable and also under dispute.
- Withdrawal of Acharya Vinobha-by 1959 an ageing Bhave withdrew from the movement.
- Allotting authorities demanded petty money from the poor for recommending their names for allotment. As a result, many undeserving villagers also got land.
- In the later phase, Bhoodan workers got associated with one or another political parties. Some of them tried to use the Bhoodan organisation as a means to gain political clout and dividends at the time of election.
- Loss of political patronage-the political class had lost its interest a few years into the launch of the movement.
- Lack of an effective organization-the movement was spearheaded by Bhave and the Sarvodaya Trust which was a voluntary organization. During the later phase the Trust lost its focus and there was a leadership vacuum. Inability of the State Boodan Committees for the distribution of land in its hands. In Bihar this led to the committee being dismissed.
- Separation from mainstream government schemes-government led initiatives such as [[Community Development Programme (CDP)\|Community Development Programme (CDP)]] and land Reform legislation had no links with the Bhoodan movement.
- Mere allotment of land is insufficient. Because landless farmer also needed seeds, fertiliser, irrigation, which were not provided and land became useless for farmer which again mostly went back to landlord.
- The average size of land given was 0.5 to 3 acres which has resulted in land fragmentation, diseconomies of scale and disguised unemployment without any noticeable rise in agro-production. 
- Radical peasant movements.

The Bhoodan movement despite all its limitation was a moral victory. It raised awareness among the people and put pressure on the landlords to voluntarily donate land to the poor. The aspirations of its founders are still unmet but the spirit the movement infused can still be witnessed in the nation
### Gramdan movement
- Involved donation of a village, Gandhian idea that all land belonged to Gopal or God. Movement started in Orissa and became most successful there.
- 1952: by the village of Mongroth in U.P.1955: Orissa, Koraput district
- The basic aim and objectives of Gramdan movement are as follows:
	1. To bring about a social order based on equality of opportunities by ensuring balanced economic distribution.
	2. Non-violent Social transformations
#### Limitation of Gramdan
- Gramdan was successful mainly in villages where class differentiation had not yet emerged and there was little if any disparity in ownership of land or other property. Ex: Tribal villages.
2. But didn’t find cooperation from other villages in the plains or villages near urban centres.
## Peasant movements: Post-independence Phase
- The years since independence have seen agrarian struggles of enormous variety, ranging from the legendary Telangana movement, Tebhaga movement, and the PEPSU tenant’s movement which continued from the pre-independence years, to the Naxalite or Maoist movement in the late sixties and the New farmers movements of the eighties.
- A shift is visible from issues arising out of colonialism and feudalism to issues arising out of the Green Revolution and other processes of agrarian change including the aspirations aroused by the struggle for land reforms.
### Telangana peasant struggle
- The peasants in Telangana suffered extreme feudal type oppression at the hands of Jagirdars and deshmukhs, some of whom owned thousands of acres of land. The communists organised the peasants against the hated forced grain levy imposed by the government, and forced labour extracted by landlords and officials.
- The people of the state grew restless of Nizam because of his delay in region’s integration with India. So, they started a movement for integration under the leadership of the State Congress.
- Camps were set up on the borders of Hyderabad with Maharashtra, coastal Andhra, etc., and arms were also sent in to help the resisters withstand the attacks of the Razakars, armed gangs of Muslim militia let loose on the predominantly Hindu population.
- Finally with the help of the Indian army, razakars were defeated and land reforms carried out in Telangana.
### New Farmers’ Movements
- The New farmers movements burst on to the national political stage in 1980 with the road and rail roko agitation in Nasik in Maharashtra led by the Shetkari Sangathana.
- The basic premise on which the movement existed is that the farmers are being exploited by Govt in the form of under payments for agricultural products and over pricing of consumer and industrial goods. As a result, farmers are exploited by urban interests, and are victims of internal colonialism.
- New farmers movements have focused mainly on demanding remunerative prices for agricultural produce, and lowering of government dues such as canal water charges, electricity charges, interest rates and principal of loans, etc.
- But many critics them for being vehicles for demands of rich or well to do agriculturists most of whom are beneficiaries of post independence agrarian development, including the [[Green Revolution\|green revolution]], and have little or no room for the concerns of the rural poor.
- The agrarian movements that emerged from the late 1970’s are often referred to as new, the suggestion being that they are part of the worldwide trend of new non-class or supra-class movements which have emerged outside the formal political party structures, examples being the women’s and environmental movements.
- Most of these farmers organisations have not shown signs of really trying hard to become a social movement. Thus, they cannot be brought into the category of new social movements.
- The new farmers movements are not all that new as similar demands were made by peasant organisations earlier as well.
- While it is true that none of the organizations were started by political parties, it is also true that over time they have inexorably got linked to politics.
### Decreased relevance of agrarian struggles from 1990s
- The single point of agitation of these movements was better returns for farmers in terms of price for the produce. From the 1990s onwards, agricultural pricing policies have ensured a healthy return to farmers for their produce. Accordingly, the upward price swings robbed these movements of their raison d’être.
- A major weakness of these movements was their failure to create an identity for farmers. The excessive dependence of these movements on regional parties also lead to their demise. But parties have varied interests and are guided by their own political interests.
- Urbanisation has resulted in mass migration of peasants living in rural areas to cities. Further, farmers are now leaving agriculture and allied activities for other sectors. These developments have severely dented the cadre base of these movements.
- Disparity among farmers belonging to different regions has been on the rise due to green revolution. The farmers of one region no longer identify with the causes of the farmers from other regions.

This has resulted in the splintering of the peasant movements along regional lines.

In today’s globalised context, farmers issues are increasingly being taken up by a vigilant media and civil society organisations. This has to some extent shrunk the political space that was exclusively available to peasant movements, who were hitherto seen as the sole vanguards of peasant causes.
### Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)
- Farmers of Haryana, Punjab and western UP had benefited in the late 1960s from green revolution. Sugar and wheat became the main cash crops in the region since then. The cash crop market faced a crisis in mid-eighties due to the beginning of the process of liberalisation of Indian economy.
- The BKU demanded higher government floor prices for sugarcane and wheat, abolition of restrictions on the inter-state movement of farm produce, guaranteed supply of electricity at reasonable rates, waiving of repayments due on loans to farmers and the provision of a government pension for farmers.
- Similar demands were made by other farmers organisations in the country. Shetkari Sanghatana of Maharashtra declared the farmers movement as a war of Bharat against forces of India.
- Another novel aspect of these mobilisations was the use of caste linkages of farmers. Most of the BKU members belonged to a single community. The organisation used traditional caste panchayats of these communities in bringing them together over economic issues.
- In spite of lack of any formal organisation, the BKU could sustain itself for a long time because it was based on clan networks among its members. Funds, resources and activities of BKU were mobilised through these networks.
- The organisation, along with the other farmers’ organisations across States, did manage to get some of their economic demands accepted. The farmers movement became one of the most successful social movements of the eighties in this respect.
### Non-party movements
- In the 1970s and 1980s, many sections of the society became disillusioned with the functioning of political parties. Failure of the Janata experiment and the resulting political instability were the immediate causes. In the long run the disillusionment was also about economic policies of the state and increasing socioeconomic inequalities. Politically active groups lost faith in existing democratic institutions and stepped outside of party politics to engage in mass mobilisation.
- Students were in the forefront in organising Dalits and Adivasis. Because of the voluntary nature of their social work, many of these organisations came to be known as voluntary organisations.
- Similarly farmers complained of neglect of agriculture sector by forming organisations like BKU.
- Women movements like anti-arrack (liquor) movement, antidowry movement got a new thrust during this period.
- In 1990s, MKSS organised public hearings, where the administration was asked to explain its stand in public. The movement had a small success when they could force an amendment in the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act. Later on, the movement gave rise to RTI.
	- The movement for Right to Information (RTI) is one of the examples of a movement that did succeed in getting the state to accept its major demand. The movement started in 1990, when a mass based organisation called the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) in Rajasthan took the initiative in demanding records of famine relief work and accounts of labourers. - Yet the real life impact of these movements on the nature of public policies seems to be very limited. This is partly because most of the contemporary movements focus on a single issue and represent the interest of one section of society. Thus it becomes possible to ignore their reasonable demands. Democratic politics requires a broad alliance of various disadvantaged social groups.
## Dalit movements
Dalit movements were fundamentally aimed at emancipation of the socially and economically backward communities and to achieve mobility. It was part of the larger democratic awakening of the people which took place during the last phase of the colonial era.
### Factors led to the growth of dalit movements
- [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/EDUCATIONAL POLICIES DURING BRITISH RAJ\|Introduction of Western education]]: it propounded the idea of equality, rationalism and scientific reasoning breaking the traditional cultural parochialism which existed.
- [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/SOCIO-RELIGIOUS REFORM MOVEMENTS\|Social Reform movements]] - like Brahmo movement-against varna hierarchy. Satya Shrodhak Samaj-Jyotiba Phule, Ayyankali, Vaikom and Guruvayur satyagrahas. 
- New Political forces-development of democratic institutions, political mobilization during the national movement-Gandhi’s Harijan movement, Ambedkarite movements-All India SC federation.
- Administrative and legal changes-establishment rule of law, law courts based on equality of law, civil bureaucracy based on meritocracy, , greater stress on meritocracy rather than traditional feudal privileges.
- New economic forces-industrialization, growth of entrepreneurship, rise of urban centres lesser importance on employment based on land like agriculture.
- Improved communication network made wider links-railways, telegraph.
- Missionary activity.
### Nature of Backward Caste movements
- Protests against discrimination of various kinds.
- To gain self respect, honour and status.
- Status mobility movements-three types (MSA Rao)
- Sanskritisation -communities like Gopas (WB), Gaulis (MH) etc -Kshatriya caste, reinterpreting Hindu religion-SNDP
- Rejection of Brahmin Aryan influence in Hinduism-Dravidian movement of the south.
- Abandoning Hinduism-embracing another religion.
- Caste unity movements.
- Caste welfare movements
### Major Movements
- Ambedkarite movements - Republican party (1956) - N Sivaraj, Mahar movement.
- Gandhi’s Harijan Movement.
- Others strands also emerged in different regions in Punjab the Ad-Dharm, in U.P. the Adi Hindi and in Bengal the Namashvedsas. In Bihar, Jagjivan Ram who emerged as the most important Congress leader formed Khetmajoor Sabhaand Depressed Class League.
- In early 1970’s a new trend identified as Dalit Panthers (1972)-JV Pawar , Namdheo Dhasal merged in Maharashtra as a part of country wide wave of radical politics. The Dalit Panthers leaned ideologically to Ambedkar’s thought. By 1950’s Dalit Panther had developed serious differences and the party split up and declined.
- In North India new party BSP (14-April 1984) emerged in 1980’s under Kanshi Ramand later Mayawati who became the chief minister of U.P. in 2007.

The struggle of the Dalit community for social and cultural equality still continues. New movements like Dalit Human Rights Movement have emerged to take forward the struggle. The community has now become politically more empowered in democratic India which can be attributed as the impacts of such movements.
## New social movements
- Old social movements are primarily seen as class based with organization of power as a central goal within the frame of political parties wider goals of universal justice and equality. 
- ==New social movements were not about changing distribution of power in society but often about quality of life.== Issues-such as environment, expression of cultural identities, sexual freedom and choice. Movement mainly led by aggressive middle class 'civil society'.
- Neo-liberalism big reason for unleashing of new social movements. The role of media is important. Class contestations have increased overtime thus leading to identity movements.
## Environmental movements
- An environmental movement can be defined as a social or political movement, for the conservation of environment or for the improvement of the state of the environment. The terms ‘green movement’ or ‘conservation movement’ are alternatively used to denote the same.
- The environmental movements favour the **sustainable management of natural resources**. The movements often stress the protection of the environment via changes in public policy. Many movements are centred on ecology, health and human rights.
- Environmental movements range from the highly organized and formally institutionalized ones to the radically informal activities.
- The spatial scope of various environmental movements ranges from being local to the almost global.
### Major grounds of the emergence of environmental movements in India:
- Control over natural resources-natural resources which is a common is however controlled by a selected few. It leads to concentration of wealth.
- False developmental policies of the government-development policies have limited perspectives, fails in redistribution and leaves a large group of people behind.
- Socioeconomic reasons
- Environmental degradation/ destruction
- Spread of environmental awareness and media.
### Major reasons of the emergence of environmental movements in India
- Chipko Movement
- Appiko Movement
- Save the Bhagirati
- Stop Tehri project committee in Uttar Pradesh
- Silent Valley movement
- Save the Narmada Movement (Narmada Bachao Andolan) in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat

### Ideology of environment movements
Gadgil, Madhav and Guha Ramchandra (1998: 450-472) have identified five broad strands within the environmental movements in India.
1. Crusading Gandhians: Crusading Gandhian, “relies heavily on a moral/religious idiom in its rejection of the modern way of life. They argue that the essence of ‘eastern’ cultures is their indifference, even hostility to economic gain.
2. Ecological Marxist: Ecological Marxists, “see the problem in political and economic terms, arguing that it is the unequal access to resources, rather than the question of values, which better explains the patterns and processes of environmental degradation in India
3. Appropriate Technology: “This strand of the environmental movement strives for a working synthesis of agriculture and industry, big and small units, and western and eastern technological traditions
4. Wilderness Enthusiasts, “have provided massive documentation of the decline of natural forests and their plant and animal species, urging the government to take remedial action.
5. Scientific Conservation: Scientific conservationists are concerned with efficiency and management
### Achievements of environmental movements
1. In creating public awareness about the importance of bringing about a balance between environment and development.
2. In opposing developmental projects that are inimical to social and environmental concerns.
3. Community participation-In organizing model projects that show the way forward towards non-bureaucratic and participatory, community-based natural resource management systems.
4. Protective legislations-Environment Protection Act, 1986, Wildlife Protection Act, National Forest Policy.
### Challenges of environmental movements
- Large scale displacement of tribals and the vulnerable continue-exploitation of resources continues and has only intensified over the years despite the various green movements.
- Large scale deforestation and destruction of nature continues.
- Exploitation of resources.
- Problems of soil degradation.
### major environmental movements in India (1700-2000)
![environmental-movement-in-india 1.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/environmental-movement-in-india%201.jpg) 
#### Bishnoi Movement
- Year: 1700s
- Place: Khejarli, Marwar region, Rajasthan state.
- Leaders: Amrita Devi along with Bishnoi villagers in Khejarli and surrounding villages.
- Aim: Save sacred trees from being cut down by the king’s soldiers for a new palace.
- What was it all about : Amrita Devi, a female villager could not bear to witness the destruction of both her faith and the village’s sacred trees. She hugged the trees and encouraged others to do the same. 363 Bishnoi villagers were killed in this movement. The Bishnoi tree martyrs were influenced by the teachings of **Guru Maharaj Jambaji**, who founded the Bishnoi faith in 1485 and set forth principles forbidding harm to trees and animals. The king who came to know about these events rushed to the village and apologized, ordering the soldiers to cease logging operations. Soon afterwards, the maharajah designated the Bishnoi state as a protected area, forbidding harm to trees and animals. This legislation still exists today in the region.
#### Chipko Movement
- Chipko Movement was started by the people of Tehri Garwhal region in the present day Uttarakhand in 1974  by the 1980s the movement had spread throughout India and led to the formulation of people sensitive forest policies, which put a stop to the open felling of trees in regions as far as the Vindhyas and the [[Western Ghats\|Western Ghats]]. 
- The Chipko is one of the world known environmental movements in India. The Chipko movement focused world attention on the environmental problems of the Himalayan ecosystem. It was a movement against deforestation and **Sunderlal Bahuguna*- was the major leader.
- It occurred at a time when there was hardly any environmental movement in the developing world and it inspired many future environmentalists, environmental protests and movements by helping to slow down the rapid deforestation, expose vested interests, increase ecological awareness and demonstrate the viability of people power. It created precedent for non-violent protest.
- The movement took up economic issues of landless forest workers and asked for guarantees of minimum wage. They demanded control over natural resources like land, water, and forests. They wanted the government to provide low cost materials to small scale industries and ensure development of the region without disturbing the ecological balance.
- Chipko movement also expressed the resentment of hill villagers against a distant government headquartered in the plains that seemed indifferent and hostile to their concerns. So concerns about economy, ecology and political representation underlay the Chipko movement.
- Methods adopted
	-	Gandhian methods of satyagraha and nonviolent resistance
	-	Embracing of trees
##### causes
- Colonial Forest Policies-Restricted the rights of the local communities over the forest wealth and resources.
- Illegal encroachment and deforestation by outsiders-the govt turned a blind eye towards it as certain elements had patrons high up in the power ladder.
- Eco-feminism
- Fragile Alakananda ecosystem - Deforestation was resulting in soil erosion and landslide affecting the agricultural activities of the locals, frequent floods.
- Soci economic reasons-Shortage of fuel wood and fodder and other minor forest products.
- Increasing man-animal conflict.
##### Impacts
- Raised awareness in the country - the people of the nation witnessed the struggle of normal citizens against the authorities in power which finally ended in their success.
- Eco feminism as a concept
- Community participation
- Inspired similar environment conservation movements. e.g. the Narmada Bachao Aandolan, Appiko etc.
- Legislative protection-National Forest policy, protection of Himalayan ecosystem.
- In 1987 Times Magazine termed Chipko movement as one of the 100 most influential developments of the 20th century.
##### Participation of women in Chipko movement
- One of Chipko’s most salient features was the mass participation of female villagers. It is being seen increasingly as an eco-[[feminism\|feminism]] movement. Women were not only its backbone, but also its mainstay, because they were the ones most affected by the rampant deforestation, which led to a lack of firewood and fodder as well as water for drinking and irrigation.
- Women became primary stakeholders in a majority of the afforestation, they set up cooperatives to guard local forests, and organised fodder production at rates conducive to local environment. They followed land rotation methods and helped replant degraded land and established and ran nurseries stocked with species they selected.
- Women held sustained agitations against the habit of alcoholism and broadened the agenda of the movement to cover other social issues.
- Gaura Devi
#### Appiko Movement
- Year: 1983.
- Place:Uttara Kannada and Shimoga districts of Karnataka State.
- Leaders: Appiko’s greatest strengths lie in it being neither driven by a personality nor having been formally institutionalised. However, it does have a facilitator in **Pandurang Hegde**. He helped launch the movement in 1983.
- Aim: Against the felling and commercialization of natural forest and the ruin of ancient livelihood.
- What was it all about : It can be said that Appiko movement is the southern version of the Chipko movement. The Appiko Movement was locally known as “Appiko Chaluvali”. The locals embraced the trees which were to be cut by contractors of the forest department. The Appiko movement used various techniques to raise awareness such as foot marches in the interior forest, slide shows, folk dances, street plays etc. The second area of the movement’s work was to promote afforestation on denuded lands. The movement later focused on the rational use of ecosphere through introducing alternative energy resourceto reducece pressure on the forest. The movement became a success. The current status of the project is –stopped.

### Indian environmentalism vs Western environmentalism
- The environmental movement in India started in the early 1970s. Major environmental movements in independent India include Chipko, Appiko and the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Though having some basic similarities, western and Indian environmentalism are qualitatively different.
- Both western and Indian environmentalism have raised issues such as protection of forests (Chipko/Appiko), compensation for industrial pollution and disasters (Bhopal Gas Tragedy) and banning of nuclear energy (Kudankulam). Also, both types of movements typically employ peaceful form of protests such as picketing, marches, sit-ins and various forms of civil disobedience.
- However, the concern for nature is couched in aesthetic terms in the west. Nature is associated with a certain quality of life that all human beings deserve to enjoy. In India, the protection of nature is portrayed as essential to the survival of the communities involved. e.g. Right to fodder.
- The social base of the environmental movements also varies. In the west, it is mostly led and constituted by the middle class, especially the new middle class of professionals. In India, poor constitute a majority of the protesters in the various environmental movements.
- Many western environmental organisations have attained a degree of formalisation and bureaucratisation and they constitute a mature environmental sector. These organisations are staffed by paid volunteers, experts, lawyers and scientists. In India, the vast majority of environmental protests are initiated by local people generally in participation with local bodies and NGOs.
- Finally, Indian cultural and religious values, especially the animistic aspects of Hindu and tribal religions, provide a spiritual basis to Indian environmentalism which is not found in the materialistic values of western religions. Hence Indian environmentalism and western environmentalism vary in terms of social base, motives, values, etc.

### Koel-Karo movement
## Cow protection movement
For a pastoral and agricultural economy like India, cow protection has always been important. However, it never took a communal turn through the centuries including under the Mughal rule. It took a communal turn when it was used for political mobilisation through Arya Samaj and cow protection movements.
### The motivation for the same
1. Religious reason: The Hindu revivalist movement including cow protection was a response to the proselytising activities of the Muslims and Christians. Hindus traditionally lacked organisational integration and Hindu mobilization took place around the issue of cow.
2. Political reason: At a time when constitutional reforms were happening and British where pitting one community against the other, each community was concerned with having a bigger share in the pie. Naturally community mobilization was important and emotive issues such as cow protection, Hindi Urdu divide etc. were used as tools for community mobilisation.
3. Social reason: Various social groups took an active part in gaurakshini sabhas to achieve their social ambitions. Zamindars participated to ensure that their social status remains maintained. Peasant communities were socially mobile and participated to display their Hindu-ness and gain legitimacy in the eyes of Hindus.

Thus is becomes apparent that while cow protection in ancient and medieval times was more for protection of cow itself, from 19th century on wards the issue gained utilitarian significance.

# Secessionist movements and threat to National Integration
## Secessionist movements in NE


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



### Secession demands
#### Insurgency in Assam
- In Assam the **problem began in 1979,** the indigenous people of Assam demanded that illegal immigrants who had emigrated from Bangladesh to Assam be detected and deported. The movement led by **All Assam Students Union** began non-violently with satyagraha, boycotts, picketing and courting arrest.
- The Election in 1983 was opposed by the movement’s leaders. The election led to widespread violence. The movement finally ended after an agreement with the central government on August 15, 1985. (**Assam Accord**)
- Under the provisions of this accord, anyone who entered the state illegally between January 1966 and March 1971 was allowed to remain but was disenfranchised for 10 years, while those who entered after 1971 face expulsion.
##### Emergence of Insurgency
- The **United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA),** an insurgent group, was formed in 1979 and marked the beginning of insurgency in Assam. The main aim of ULFA was to **“liberate Assam through armed struggle from the exploitative attitude of the central government towards Assam and establish a sovereign independent Assam.”**
- The group **remained dormant**  during the Assam movement; however, it supported the Assam movement. The Assam movement was against the illegal migrants. ULFA also raised the similar issue, which gained popularity and acceptability of the common population.
##### Issue of NRC
- Bangladeshi immigrants had affected the demography of Assam.
- NRC is an exercise first carried out 1951 to enumerate the citizens, their houses and holdings. 
- It is an official record of all the legal citizens of a state in respect of each village showing the houses or holdings in a serial order and indicating against each house or holding the number and names of persons staying therein. 
- Over the years there has been a demand from the indigenous Assamese groups to update the NRC.
#### Nagalim insurgency
- The Nagas were the inhabitants of the Naga hills along the Northeast frontier on the Assam-Burma border. 
- The Nagas are not a single tribe, but an ethnic community that comprises several tribes who live in the state of Nagaland and its neighbourhood.
- In 1946 came the **Naga National Council (NNC)**, which, under the leadership of **Angami Zapu Phizo**, declared Nagaland an independent state on August 14, 1947.
- The first and the most significant insurgency started in Nagaland under the leadership of Phizo in the early 1950.
- The NNC resolved to establish a “sovereign Naga state” and conducted a “referendum” in 1951, in which “99 percent” supported an “independent” Nagaland.
- In 1952, Phizo formed the underground Naga Federal Government (NFG) and the Naga Federal Army (NFA). The Government of India sent in the Army to crush the insurgency and, in 1958, enacted the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. 
- Insurgents aims to establish a ‘**Greater Nagaland** (‘Nagalim’ or the People’s Republic of Nagaland) based on  **Mao Tse Tung’s ideology**. Its manifesto is based on the principle of Socialism for economic development.
	- A “Greater Nagalim” comprising **“all contiguous Naga-inhabited areas”,**  along with Nagaland. That included **several districts of Assam, Arunachal and Manipur**, as also a  **large tract of Myanmar**.
	- The map of “Greater Nagalim” has about 1,20,000 sq km, while the state of Nagaland consists of 16,527 sq km. The claims have always kept Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh wary of a peace settlement that might affect their territories.
- The Nagaland Assembly has endorsed the ‘Greater Nagalim’ demand – **“Integration of all Naga Inhabited contiguous areas under one administrative umbrella”** – as many as five times: in December 1964, August 1970, September 1994, December 2003 and as recently as on July 27, 2015.
- **Shillong Accord in 1975** made the NNC laid down its arms and signed a Peace Agreement with Government of India.
- The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) was formed on January 31, 1980 by Isak Chisi Swu, Thuingaleng Muivah and S.S. Khaplang to  **opposed the ‘Shillong Accord’**  signed by the then NNC (Naga National Council) with the Indian government. 
- Later, differences surfaced within the outfit over the issue of commencing a dialogue process with the Indian Government and on April 30, 1988, the NSCN split into two factions, namely the NSCN-K led by S S Khaplang, and the NSCN-IM, led by Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah.
##### Peace efforts
- Nine Point Agreement
	- Signed by the governor of Assam and Naga leaders on June 26, 1947.
	- Under this agreement it was decided that the Nagas would be granted judicial, executive, and legislative powers, as well as autonomy in land related matters.
	- There was a 10 year guarantee of these provisions at the end of which the Nagas could choose between extending the agreement or a new agreement.
	- The Naga leaders were also promised unification of Naga territories from nearby districts into the Naga hill district.
	- However, the constituent Assembly refused to ratify this accord.
- Sixteen-point Agreement with the Naga People’s Convention of 1960.
- Shillong Accord of 1975.
- **Naga Peace Accord 2015**:
	- Nagaland peace accord is the accord signed in August 2015 by the Government of India and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) to end the insurgency.
	- The framework agreement is based on the “**unique**” history of Nagas and recognises the universal principle that in a democracy sovereignty lies with the people.
	- National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) has given up its demand for ‘Greater Nagaland’ and vowed allegiance to the constitution of India. The details of the accord are yet to come in public domain.
	- The Government of India has also made clear that existing boundaries of states will not be altered.
	- It will restore peace and pave the way for prosperity in the North East.
	- It will advance a life of dignity, opportunity and equity for the Naga people, based on their genius and consistent with the uniqueness of the Naga people and their culture and traditions.
	- The Government of India recognized the unique history, culture and position of the Nagas and their sentiments and aspirations. The NSCN understood and appreciated the Indian political system and governance.
	- The Nagas peace accord has been hanging fire since a framework agreement was signed with NSCN-IM in 2015. Naga groups even carried out a rally in Delhi demanding early finalisation of Naga Peace Accord.
#### Manipur insurgency
- Manipur was declared a  **separate state in 1972.**
- The Manipur people are grouped into three communities,  **Meitei, Nagas and Kuki or Chins.**  Meitei live in plain, while Nagas and kukis are in the hill district.
- There were many tensions between the different tribal groups in the state.
- The emergence of insurgency in Manipur is formally traced to the emergence of the **United National Liberation Front (UNLF) in 1964**.
- Since then several other outfits, like the  **People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of Manipur, founded in 1978, People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) set up in 1977 and the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP)**  that came into being in April, 1980 have emerged in the valley areas consisting of four districts of the State.
- The situation is further complicated because as, violence by the **Naga groups has also spilled over into Manipur, a substantial part of which is claimed by the Isak-Muivah faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) as part of Nagalim or Greater Nagaland**, the proposed unified territory of the Nagas as claimed by the Naga rebels. Several clashes between the NSCN-IM and the Khaplang faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K) have been reported from the hill districts of the State.
- **Manipur had been declared a ‘disturbed area’ in its entirety in 1980 and the Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA), 1958 was imposed in the State on 8 September, 1980, which continues to be in place till now**. 
- The implementation of this Act resulted in the State witnessing an unprecedented civic uprising, including the infamous **“mothers’ nude protest”** and  **Irom Sharmila Hunger strike against the Act**. The AFSPA is still embroiled in controversy and the people of Manipur are continuing their protest against the Act.
- Manipur witnessed a series of protests starting in July 2015, following demands for the implementation of the **Inner Line Permit (ILP)** system in the State. 
- The protesters have demanded that the government introduce the ILP bill in the State Assembly. 
	- Manipur, along with Dimapur district of Nagaland, was brought under the purview of the [[ILP System\|ILP System]] in December 2019.
		- Dimapur was the only place in Nagaland which was not under the ILP system because the district is a commercial hub and has a mixed population (often referred to as ‘Mini India’).
	- The system is in force in the neighbouring States of Nagaland and Mizoram and also in Arunachal Pradesh.
#### Insurgency in Mizoram
- Large scale disturbances broke out on 28th February 1966 government installations at Aizawl, Lunglei, Chawngte, Chhimluang and other places simultaneously under the **Mizo National Front (MNF)** led by **Laldenga** with the specified goal of achieving sovereign independence of **Greater Mizoram**.
- Government had to use Air Force to fight the insurgents. (first ever incident)
- The Mizo National Front was outlawed in 1967.
- The demand for statehood has gained fresh momentum. A Mizo District Council delegation, which met prime Minister Indira Gandhi in May 1971 demanded a full-fledged state for the Mizos. 
- The union government on its own offered the proposal of turning Mizo Hills into a Union Territory in July 1971. The Mizo leaders were ready to accept the offer on condition that the status of U.T would be upgraded to statehood sooner rather than later. 
- The Union Territory of Mizoram came into being on 21st January, 1972. Mizoram got two seats in Parliament, one each in the Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha.
- In June **1986**, the centre signed a peace agreement (**Mizo Accord**) with Laldenga, leader of the Mizo National Front (MNF). By its terms, the MNF rebels laid down their arms and were granted amnesty against prosecution. The government granted full statehood to Mizoram.
- Among the ethnic and secessionist conflicts, the resolution of the Mizoram issue was a notable success.
#### Insurgency in Tripura
- The state of Tripura  **witnessed a surge in terrorist activities in the 1990s.**  The main reason was the influx of refugees from the newly formed Bangladesh.
- **Influx of refugees**  fuelled discontent and demographic inversion in Tripura.
- This led to insurgent activities in the state of Tripura and the formation of the **Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti (TUJS)** in 1971, followed by the Tripura National Volunteers (TNV) in 1981.
- The  **National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT)** was formed on March 2, 1989 and its armed wing, the National Holy Army and All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF), in July 1990, queered the pitch.
- But today Tripura is **one of the successful states in curbing insurgency**  in the state.
##### Famous Tripura model
- A multidimensional and fine-tuned solution provided by the government of Tripura. 
- Working on all these multiple fronts Tripura succeeded in fighting against the insurgency.

## Various missions post-independent India
1. Drinking water mission: The idea was to use satellites and the disciplines of geology, civil engineering and biochemistry for identifying, extracting and cleansing water supplies. The mission also included an effort to educate people how to repair broken pumps.
2. Immunizations: In 1987, India had the highest amount of polio in the world. They developed a cold chain for handling the vaccines with industrialists to get refrigeration to all parts of India. Several years later, India was producing all of their own vaccines. 25 years later, in 2013, India was declared polio-free.
3. Literacy: The literacy mission was aimed at attacking the serious problem of mass illiteracy.This was to be achieved by making use of and extending the television network in rural areas, as well as by using video and audio cassettes and other methods.
4. Oilseeds: India was importing one billion dollars of cooking oils each year, when large portions of Indian land are well suited to growing oil crops. Farmers did not grow these crops as they were less profitable. Once the intervention on oil was complete, India was exporting oil cakes at the rate of 600 million per year.
5. Telecommunication: The official goal of the telecom mission was to improve service, dependability, and accessibility of telecommunications across the county. This was through indigenous development, local young talent, rural telecom, digital switching networks, local manufacturing and privatization. The official goal is to bring one telephone to every part of the country.
6. Dairy: The goal of the dairy mission was to develop and implement technologies to improve breeding, animal health, and fodder and milk production.
