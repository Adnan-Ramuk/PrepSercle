# Adapted provisions from constitution of different countries
- The constitution of India is remarkable for many outstanding features even though it has been prepared after ransacking all the known constitutions of the world and most of its provision are substantially borrowed from others.
- Indian constitution has borrowed various provision from different Constitutions existing at that time.
- Although our Constitution could be considered to be "borrowed," the framers deserve credit for compiling the best elements of each of the existing constitutions and then altering them to avoid the flaws that have been revealed in their functioning and to adapt them to the current conditions and needs of this nation. So if it is a 'patchwork', it is a 'beautiful patchwork'.
