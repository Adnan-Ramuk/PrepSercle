# Utilitarianism
>Utilitarianism is a moral doctrine which says that actions are right if they are useful or for the benefit of a majority. #definition #introduction 
- the basic idea behind different versions of utilitarianism is the sense of **maximization of utility**.

- Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as egoism and altruism, utilitarianism considers the interests of all humans equally.
- John Stuart Mill, medieval Indian philosopher Śāntideva were also proponents of Utilitarianism. 
- The concept has been applied towards social welfare economics, the dropping of the atomic bombs in [[World War II\|World War II]], the crisis of global poverty, the ethics of raising animals for food, and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity.
