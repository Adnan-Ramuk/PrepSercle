# Agriculture in IVC
>The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) stands as one of the most remarkable ancient civilizations in history, thriving around 2600 to 1900 BCE in the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent. Among its many achievements, the IVC was at the forefront of agricultural innovation, introducing practices that continue to influence modern farming. #introduction 
- The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was the first civilization to produce cotton.
- They practiced agriculture and domesticated cattle, dogs, and cats.
- Evidences of ploughed fields have been found in Kalibangan, and terracotta models of ploughs have been discovered in Banawali.
- The crops cultivated in the IVC included wheat, barley, peas, and rice. Historians suggest that multicropping was practiced, indicating advanced agricultural techniques.
- For water storage, the IVC used gabarbands or Nala's.
- Surplus food was stored in granaries. Notably, the granary at Harappa was more advanced compared to the one found at Mohen-jo-Daro.
    - The Harappa granary featured two rows of six rooms each, with a brick-lined walkway in the middle.
    - The rooms were separated from each other through air ducts, providing safety against flooding and pest attacks.
- The IVC's agricultural success can be attributed to their sophisticated urban planning, efficient water management, and well-designed irrigation systems.
	- The efficient water management and irrigation systems of the Indus Valley Civilization allowed them to cope with periods of low rainfall, ensuring a stable food supply for their growing urban centers.
- Archaeological evidence suggests that the IVC might have also cultivated various other crops, including sesame, mustard, and sugarcane.
- The use of manure and organic waste as fertilizers played a crucial role in maintaining soil fertility and ensuring sustainable agriculture.
- The existence of extensive trade networks facilitated the exchange of agricultural products, leading to economic growth and cultural exchange.
