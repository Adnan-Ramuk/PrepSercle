- 74th amendment added Part IXA to the constitution
## Various qualifications for Panchayats
- Recently SC has upheld the amendments to the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994. Amendments introduce certain disqualifications for contesting Panchayat elections, like lack of formal education, lack of sanitation and indebtedness. The amendment was challenged for violating right to equality.
### Judgement
- The court observed that the illiteracy, lack of sanitation etc., are due to lack of requisite will, rather than only due to poverty.
- The court also tried to link education with competence to effectively discharge duties of the Panchayats.
- The court further justified the logic of debt based disqualification by stating that election is an expensive affair, and that a debt ridden person would not, in any case, be eligible to contest.
- Therefore, it upheld the amendments to promote social good in the society.
#### Pros
- This ensures that the proxy candidates are not fighting elections which come from local families who are traditionally in politics in villages. Family tries to wrest power at as many points they can by projecting all their candidates and hence excluding new comers in politics.
- So this type of act will help new generation to join local politics as many traditional local Sarpanch will be forced to retire after this new law.
- This act will motivate masses to study at the time when primary education is fundamental right.
- Local Government is the first point of interaction between public and state. So the need to provide quality services and for this they need to be literate.
- The apex court held that the classification of persons with two or less children was not arbitrary and the disqualification seeks to promote a national programme by creating disincentives.
- The court also looked into the functions given to Panchayats and noted that family welfare was an important function assigned to Panchayats and the legislation to disqualify therefore served one of the important objectives. So, similarly this also is necessary.
#### Cons
- It can lead to a race to procure bogus certificates of educational qualification.
- It violates Article 14 that is of right to equality. Old people who had no means to study in their times will be excluded, without any fault on their part.
- Only local elections can accommodate downtrodden people whohave limited means to fight elections. The most affected due to this is are women, people from backward classes especially SCs and STs because of their historical disadvantage of not having access to education.
- It would strengthen the domination of upper castes. There is a chance of increasing violence against backward classes and women which was checked till now by political participation of these classes.
- Formal education cannot suggest that a person is desirable for a constitutional post or not. If we go by this ordinance then tall figures like Guru Rabindranath Tagore and Kamraj will stand disqualified.
- It looks weird that a person who is not qualified to be elected as Sarpanch, is eligible to be elected as Member of Parliament (or even Prime Minister). This should have been done on the basis of empirical data, deliberation and consultation with various stake holders.

## Gram Sabha
- Gram Sabha is a body consisting of all the persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level.
- Since all the persons registered in electoral rolls are members of Gram Sabha, there are no elected representatives. 
- Further, Gram Sabha is the only permanent unit in Panchayati Raj system and not constituted for a particular period. 
- Although it serves as foundation of the Panchayati Raj, yet it is not among the three tiers of the same. 
- The powers and functions of Gram Sabha are fixed by state legislature by law.

## Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)
### Finance of ULBs
- The scale of municipal finances is largely inadequate.
- Fiscal deficits, constraints in tax base expansion, and weakening of institutional mechanisms are challenges.
- The ULBs' key revenue sources are taxes, fees, fines and charges and transfers from Central and State governments (Inter-Governmental Transfers-IGTs).
- ULBs' own revenue was 47% of their total revenue
- Many ULBs were highly dependent on IGTs (about 40% of their total revenue)
- Smaller cities are more dependent on grants, while larger cities find their revenue from taxes.
- Operations and Maintenance (O&M) expenses of ULBs are on the increase but still inadequate.
