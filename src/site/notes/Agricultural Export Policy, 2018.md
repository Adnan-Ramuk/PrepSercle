# Agricultural Export
- Even though India has unique competitive advantages in agricultural sector with the **largest arable land area** (60.44 percent) of an estimated 179.8 million hectares and **diverse agro-climatic conditions** supporting the cultivation of various crops, the share of India in the globally traded key Agri-commodities is very low, accounting for less than 1% in most of the products.

## Impediments to Agri Export
- Low productivity.
- Inefficient and unorganized backward integration - especially for perishables resulting in quality and longevity issues.
- Multiple ministries and multiple regulators results in lack of coordination and holistic policies.
- Lack of synergy between the state and central government as **agriculture is a state subject**, while the state‘s role for exports is undefined.
- Lack of sufficient cold storage and training affects shelf life produce.
- Documentation and procedures to be followed for exports. It is difficult to get an Export License.
- State-of-the-art testing and grading labs are not available in India.
- Lack of awareness on existing schemes and policies related to exports.
- Packaging, Sanitary and Phytosanitary issues. e.g. EU‘s ban of import of Alphonso mango, Basmati rice.
## Agricultural Export Policy, 2018
- Ambitious target of $60 billion by 2022. Contribution of agricultural and processed food products in India's exports is 11%.
- Policy changes: Reforms in APMC Act and streamlining of mandi fee.
- Infrastructure: Creating inland transportation links alongside dedicated agricultural infrastructure at ports with 24x7 customs clearance for perishables.
- Quality regimen: A holistic response to Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) barriers faced by Indian products.
- Focus on clusters: Involvement and engagement of small and medium farmers for entire value chain as group enterprise within cluster of villages at the block level for select produce.
- Creation of Agri-start-up fund: Entrepreneurs are to be supported to start a new venture in Agri products exports.
- Promote value added organic exports. Organic products in North East development of ‘AMUL’ style cooperatives.
- Marketing and promotion of Brand India.
- Attract private investments in export oriented activities and infrastructure.
- Greater involvement of state governments in agriculture exports.
## Other measures taken
- Farm to port project - special focus on export to middle east market.
- [[Farmer Producers Organisation (FPO)\|Farmer Producers Organisation (FPO)]] would reduce the cost of production and increase quality of agri products.
- Focus on Organic farming, which has huge export potential.

### Agri Export Zones (AEZ)
- To give thrust to export of agro products, new concept of Agri export zones was brought in 2001. APEDA has been nominated as the Nodal Agency to coordinate the efforts on the part of Central Govt. negotiations.
- The cluster approach of identifying the potential products and geographical region in which these products are grown.
- Adopting an end-to-end approach of integrating the entire process right from the stage of production till it reaches the market. There would also be a need to identify problems encountered at each stage.
- Identification of such potential crops is responsibility of state governments. Projects in such areas for identified crops will be eligible for financial assistance and certain fiscal incentives.
#### Problems in agri-export zones
- Government agencies don’t take ownership or responsibility.
- Villagers and field officers are unaware about the scheme and its conceptual framework.
- The design of AEZ itself doesn’t have project orientation.
- Lack of coordination or monitoring in AEZs.
- The investment made by central and state government has not materialised into real useful assets on the ground.
- Indiscreet proliferation of AEZs in certain states. WB, Maharashtra have multiple Agro export zones while Odisha barely got one AEZ and that too in 2013.
