# Agricultural labour
Given the fact that a large part of Indian workers were in the [[unorganised sector\|unorganised sector]] with almost no bargaining power, the workers were likely to be exploited by employers and paid below subsistence wages and hence **Minimum wages #Act, 1948** was passed.
## Lacunae in the implementation of Act
- Informalisation of the tenants due to unintended consequences of stringent tenancy laws, thus, making the formal identification of the labourers difficult to implement the act.
- Less focus on increasing awareness about the act among workers. The workers are compelled to accept lower wages due to factors such as weak bargaining power, lack of availability of work, indebtedness etc.
- Low penalties for non-compliance dissuade employer to contravene the provisions of the Act. Also the procedure for imposing the penalty is cumbersome.
- Enforcement responsibility vested in the states and thus, we have vast differences in the minimum wages fixed in different states and for different activities and occupations. It makes monitoring and fixing accountability challenging.
## Measures to be taken
- Reforming the tenancy laws to prevent informalisation and ensuring welfare of agricultural workers.
- Linking wages with CPI and updating it every 5 years as provided in the minimum wage act.
- Skilling agricultural labour to increase their bargaining power and also open up different avenues of employment to reduce disguised unemployment.
- Digital empowerment of workers to connect them to labour market and find decent low skilled works in the nearby areas.
- Better compliance with minimum wage act by simplification of the act. Steps should be taken to reduce multiplicity of minimum wage rates across centre and states.
- Increasing the penalties of non-compliance and increasing awareness of labour force.

>The implementation of the act in letter as well as spirit only can help India to achieve the ideals enshrined under **Article 43** of the Indian constitution. #conclusion
